something both trendy and relevant   what s that   a bar  a high end bar   you know the manila party scene is booming right now   ants  the italian you took care of   left you 40 million in his will   but that 40 million will easily vanish   if you don t take care of it properly   actually  it s not even 40 million anymore   because you bought this house   then  you also bought one for your family   then  you bought a car   i just don t want you to invest in something   that will surely fail   babe   i ve been with you six months now   when have i ever been wrong   hmm   so much drama   okay

you see  i met anton on a cruise ship a few months ago   he s not used to how it is to live in my world   now your job is to transform him   so that he can mingle with a high end crowd   which is the

 exactly that   and you  what does she like about you   oh  that  that i get  it s because my sir tonio   ah  maybe it s your job   cause miss monica is known for dating accomplished men   where are

pale so we rushed him here   mommy   mom  are you okay   doc  how is my husband   he s fine for now   we are doing some tests   and it seems he has stones in his gallbladder   we need to operate on your husband   what we have to do is schedule the procedure immediately   based on what anton said   you broke every single rule in public relations   i m sorry  miss monica   please don t fire me   i ought to fire you  but i won t   because i m giving this project to liana   miss monica  i need this project   it doesn t seem like you want it   miss monica  please don t take the project away from me   i ll prove that i can do it   that i m deserving of the promotion   please  miss monica  please give me another chance   don t talk to me  talk to anton   he s the client   and as far as i m concerned he doesn t wanna see you   he doesn t wanna have anything to do with you   so  good luck in trying to convince him to take you back   what  you got something to say   i m too busy counting

cause your insults really hit home   you know  it was my decision to wait for you   i made that choice   eventually  i realized that i should be mad at myself   because  i chose to be stupid   i m sorry that i left you hanging   you know   i completely understand   that you had to board a ship for work   but to leave without saying a word   you didn t talk to me or come and see me one last time   i found that hard to accept   and i waited for you   i even told myself   you ll explain everything to me because you love me   but come to think of it   i realized you never once told me you loved me   so  it was stupid of me to assume that you loved me   oh  well   i guess when someone courts you it doesn t mean he loves you   i did love you   oh well  the past is the past   let s leave it behind us it s been seven long years   anyway  it s better this way   because if we ended up together   i might have been a hindrance to you   hmm   you might not be as successful as you are now   tonio  i m really sorry   i m sorry for everything i said   it s okay  we re good   mmm    high five  kiss   mmm   hi  i m stephanie asuncion   i will be your pr specialist  and you are    tonio

and as the owner of the bar   that s also the image you ll need to project   and the first step to achieving that is appearance management   you are the brand ambassador of your business   so  just like your bar   you have to be posh modern  and cool    posh  modern  cool  indeed   that s the look we re going for   i ll take care of him  please sit  sir    okay  i ll go ahead  mama mae  tep

  we ll use our hands    oh  mamae  let s use our hands  i will use my feet   your feet   mmm  okay  i m done i m so full  thank you    you liked it  hmm  delicious   but i think we should take a walk   to help digest the food   yeah  walk around  take a walk around the whole house   go ahead   i had no idea you knew how to cook back then   when i worked on the cruise ship   i was assigned to the kitchen    that s where i learned to cook  hmm   so that s how miss monica fell for you   by putting a spell on her food during her cruise   of course not  that s not even where we met   we met in orvieto  italy    what  in italy  yeah   i only spent one year on the ship  then i hopped off   i ended up working as a caregiver   then i met my employer   he looks like your grandfather   that s why i felt at ease taking care of him   did you have a hard time taking care of him   not really  but it s the loneliness that will get you   there aren t many filipinos there   plus  se or luigi s vineyard was in a provincial area   oh   last year  his closest friends visited him   monica was with them   but after a few days se or luigi passed away   monica was the one who helped me   she really surprised me she didn t mind doing the work   washing the dishes serving the funeral guests    really  miss monica did  yeah   really  she doesn t seem to be the type    hey  she s not like that  thank you   i think you re talking about a different girlfriend  tonio   you just don t know monica like i do   so  why did miss monica tell me   that she met you on a cruise ship   maybe because that s where we bonded   when se or luigi died he left me a lot of money   and he left strict instructions for me to go on vacation   so when monica told me she was going on a cruise   i went with her   that s where you got to know all of monica   meaning  that s where you meddled   with monica s mufflers   mama mae  so  so  what   i m just worried about you   i just don t want you getting hurt by tonio s answer   because  you know   mama mae  whatever tonio says   will have no effect on me anymore   and obviously   that s where they they first  you know    right  first what   first time you meddled   meddled with    the mufflers  whose   monica s    my gosh  what are you saying  ouch    disgusting  sorry   my god   i m sorry   i ll just shut up and drink my coffee   hello  babes  i mean  babe   how are your mufflers   i mean your   it s mama mae s fault   you know  you may not be feeling hurt    but i am hurting for you  mmm   mm hm   it s going well i m learning a lot   she s just a bit temperamental and strict   oh  my god   anton  is that you   yes  babes  that s me   ants   it s me  not  that s me   sorry  babes  uh babe  do you like this   i love it  you look so hot   did steph pick out those clothes for you   yes  steph is really good   i m learning a lots from her   except for good grammar   but you look so hot anyway   tep  did you get the thing i sent you   you sent me something   guys  there s a special delivery for steph    hurry up  i want to have some  so sweet  caramel flan    sir anton  your card please  thank you so much   the package just arrived    this is too much  thank you   thank you so much  monica was so happy last night   sorry  i wasn t able to drop by i had to wire money to grandpa   for his medication   it s okay  thank you for the food you sent   and that other thing i sent    has it arrived  other thing   there s more    flowers for steph  is it there yet   excuse me  i have flowers for miss monica t  valencia   tep  are they

worked so hard on   what you have worked hard on   thank you   oh  you have a meeting tomorrow with mtv s friend   who wants to invest in your bar   why not have your date with mtv after the meeting   if you want  i can make reservations for you   tep  what if i set up a furniture shop instead   that s what i really want anyway   it s just monica who thinks it s a waste of money   huh  it s not a waste of money  you re very good at that   i promise you  once your shop opens up   i ll be your first customer    really  sure   i ll even do pr work for you for free    really  uh huh   you know   i think you just need to show your work to miss monica   i m sure she ll be impressed   why not bring her to your province   oh  why are you still up   i m just editing a video presentation for a client   mmm   uh  by the way who drove you home   my new client    he looks like  like tonio   mm mm    that was tonio  mommy  he s your client   my god  steph  he s nothing but trouble   you need to get away from him while you can   unbelievable   go to the province with you  what  why   i ll introduce you to my family   i ll also show you my woodwork   i want to prove to you that setting up a furniture shop   won t be a waste of money   i just can t see myself running a high end bar   is this because i missed dinner last night   so you re backing out  is that it   monica  i m not interested in setting up a bar   then study up on it   why do you keep insisting on this furniture thing   monica  you re my girlfriend   but you don t seem to have faith in me   unlike steph who has complete faith in me   ants  sorry  i have faith in you   okay  i m gonna reconsider that furniture thing   but i can t go to the province with you   maybe next time  okay   move my meeting with mr  reyes to 4 p m   and tell him i m on my way  okay    yes  ma am  miss monica    yes  can i ask you something   okay  make it fast because i m busy   what   i saw your car outside the restaurant last night   why didn t you come in   follow me   actually  i kind of feel guilty about it   i just wish life was less complicated   when i met him in italy   i was still heartbroken over andrew   so when anton told me he wanted to come with me on the cruise   i was okay with it   normally  i wouldn t have allowed it   because i barely knew him   but  you know  he made me laugh   he made me feel beautiful and special   have you ever felt that way  steph   his rural attitude his corny humor   even his bad grammar all of that was so wonderful   that was back then  when we were still in paradise   but not now  when we re back in the real world   it s just better to introduce him to family and friends   as a fellow passenger that i met on a cruise ship   there s no way that i would tell them   i m in a relationship with a seaman   turned caregiver   it s embarrassing   he had an honorable job   steph  don t be so naive   after all  we re in the world of pr   and that s not the point   this is the first guy   who is willing to do anything for me   who is willing to change for me   that s why i really want this relationship to work   but you confronting me like this   and planting seeds of hope in his furniture shop   miss monica  if you could just give anton a chance   i did  i told him i would reconsider   but only after i ve been proven wrong   that it s not going to be a waste of money   catch my drift   steph  i think this is going beyond   what miss monica is asking of you   this is girlfriend level effort   for a guy you claim to be just a friend   steph  i m just concerned for you   this might be another m u  for you   a mis understanding with major uncertainty    come on  let s grab some lunch  okay   i might lose some weight   oh  gosh  i m super excited   i m ready for the beach   see  look at me  i put on sunscreen  oh   show a little excitement i can t believe you   finally  you get to introduce me to your family   mm mm    tep  you re in uniform   what are you doing here do we have a session   no  but   i heard mtv can t go with you to the province   to see your furniture   yeah  i m kind of bummed out about it   mmm  no  no  no  you re not allowed to mope   i m here because   i m going to make sure that mtv will still see your furniture   so  instead of her coming over to see your work   your work will come to see her  okay   i ll do it    tep  yeah    mmm  huh   mmm   mmm   oh  ah   got it   yes    mmm  huh  there s  there s more   no  you still got food  give it here   i want some more    you finished it  mama mae   you might get fat   yes

together   hmm   you should have heard him say  there was never an us   they re fooling each other   you re like a newlywed couple separated by sadness    that s not true  no  we re not   oh  yes  you were   you almost didn t board your ship  remember   huh   uncle  that s not true tep might believe you   remember when you were in manila   you were drunk every night   and every time you got drunk you sang    tep  tep  tep  tep  tep    with matching tears   that s too much tep might believe you   too much  you were too drunk   they even had to dunk your head in a drum of water   just to get rid of your hangover    hey  steph got drunk  too  hey   you got drunk  tep   tonio  you didn t know about that   because he didn t want to talk about steph back then    okay  enough  she reeked of booze    hyro  right  mom   wait  so what if she got drunk   i wasn t drunk   that was when she came back to look for you   the second time she came back   susan   three months later   tep  did you really come back here   oh  she came back   wait  you tease them like tonio doesn t have monica    she was even waiting for  hyro  that s enough   don t you remember  mom you were the one tep cried to   then her daddy came to pick her up    okay  stop now  stop now  son  why  mom   can you just pass me the rice    we have to eat everything okay  that s right   it seems you re getting thinner   it s very

before someone else catches a cold   thank you   why are you still up   my cold is curable  i ll be able to sleep now   but i don t think there s a cure for whatever you re feeling   kooks    how are you  well  i m okay   steph  i would just like to remind you   you re doing this for your future promotion   your past with tonio   it has nothing to do with it  okay   so  please  don t go back to being stupid  okay  i love you    two old friends meet again     wearin  older faces     talk about the places they ve been     steph    two old sweethearts     get over it    who fell apart somewhere long ago    why do you have to find out when it s already in the past    how were they to know     someday they d meet again     and have a need for more than reminisin      maybe this time it ll be lovin  they ll find     maybe now they can be more than just friends     she s back in his life and it feels so right     maybe this time love won t end     yeah yeah yeah yeah     did you get drunk over me  did you come back for me    it s the same old feeling     tonio  steph  let s go    back again     it s the one they had way back when     they were too young to know when love is real     but somehow some things never change     and even time hasn t cooled the flame     it s burnin  even brighter than it did before    it s okay    it got another chance and if they take it    ah    wow  just like newlyweds    maybe this time     it ll be lovin  they ll find     maybe now they can be more than just friends     she s back in his life and it feels so right     maybe this time love won t

t just throw away   because you just can t forget about them   because you just can t let them go   tonio  that s not what s written here   it wasn t easy   to walk away   it was the most difficult decision you ever had to make   but at that time   it was the right thing to do   you shouldn t be saying those things   but what you thought you d lost   has come back   and you take it back   because it s precious to you   because you realize that you still love her   you got hurt   tep  i know   there was never an us   there will never be an us   so  please  stop flirting with me   tep  sorry   sorry if you think that i   that i m flirting with you   but i m not   it s not like that   i don t know what to do   i don t know how i feel   it s nothing  tonio   you don t feel anything   you shouldn t feel anything   and i shouldn t feel anything   because there was never an us   but we loved each other   tep  i loved you   believe me   i loved you   tonio   you were my first love   everyone made fun of me   because we never became a couple but i went crazy over you   because every part of my body   was hurting  sad   every part of my body was longing for you   that s why i came back here   because i thought you might be here   forgive me   i got so drunk that night   that s why my dad had to pick me up   he was tired and it was dark  we got into an accident   my dad was paralyzed because of my stupidity over you   and to this day   i m still paying the price for that stupidity   but even after all the pain you ve caused me   i still love you  tonio   i still love you   you think you re the only one who suffered   the night before we were supposed to meet   your mother talked to me   she told me i would only hinder you   from reaching your dreams   but if i really wanted you   then i should take you  but you could never go back to them   it was a lot to take   you were a coward    i wasn t ready  tep  you were a coward   admit it  tonio you were a coward   because i wasn t ready   what life could i offer you   how was i supposed to give you the life you were used to   that was not the life i wanted   a life with you was more than enough for me   but not for me   because i love you   because i wanted to give you a good life   i didn t want you to go through the same hardships i did   you should have said that   i should have heard that   so that i could have told you that i can wait   until you were sure   until you were ready   i would have waited no matter how long   because i loved you  tonio   you should have showed up   i waited for you   tep  please forgive me   because if i came to meet you   there s no way i could have left you   tep  i m sorry   coming back here was a mistake   you already  you already love someone else   steph  i m so sorry   all this time  i ve done nothing but hurt you   please  tonio  let s stop this   just tell me it s over    steph  can you   can you please stop telling me   that you love me   just tell me that it s over   please   it s over   what  you spent the weekend in the province with steph   why didn t you tell me   and what s all this talk about driftwood furniture   monica  this is what i really want to do   and you think you re gonna be successful with it   teptep thinks i can do it   even when we were younger she always believed in my dream   teptep   stephanie   yeah  steph   you knew each other   even before   that was a long time ago  it s not important   why didn t you tell me   there was nothing to tell   don t lie to me   monica  that s in the past   it s over   we will be launching a web series with cliffhangers   and have a text poll over kakao   to find out how the next webisode should begin   we ll be developing a new group of emoticons to tell the story   it s going to be like an animated short   i smell a promotion   and to generate more buzz   we are going to launch via a campus tour   just like what you did before   i like it  it s fresh and innovative   but what will the story of the short films be   a love story   girl and boy meet one summer   what do the letters a   m stand for   anton and monica   but their love story was cut short that summer   but a few years later  they meet again   so this time   will monica and anton have their happy ending   okay  i like it  and it s a go   congratulations  monica   you came up with all that   yes  i

 congrats  liana   thank you  ma am    what  i deserve it   deserve what   the promotion you gave to liana   excuse me   get out of my way   everything you presented were my ideas   and you didn t even bother to tell them   that they weren t yours   i was the one who put this together  not you   i was the one who worked on all of them   you worked on all of them including my boyfriend   don t you dare deny it  i can see right through you   i didn t do anything wrong   but you wanted to  you wanted to steal him from me   i would never steal him from you   i am not like you   you wanted to go back to the province   because you wanted to bring back the past   oh  yes  i know everything   if that s the case   you should know that it s over  it s all in the past   it better be  because he s my boyfriend now   so stop being delusional   you can t compete with me  don t even try   you lying  backstabbing boyfriend snatching slut   really now   this   coming from a shallow   manipulative   two faced bitch   i don t want to deal with this garbage   i m not done yet    let go  no  you listen to me   before you call me a liar   it s time for you to come clean   do you really love tonio    yes  i love him  no  you don t   because if you truly love him you wouldn t force him to change   just so he can be good enough for you   don t even try to   and don t you dare call me a backstabber   i never betrayed you   i respected your relationship with tonio   so you have no right calling me a slut    you re fired  no  i quit    tep  babe   this is not the right time for you to resign  stephanie   mommy   i can t stand my boss anymore   she s so unfair   not only to me  but also to tonio   tonio  what the hell  stephanie   you almost quit school before now  you ve quit your job   you re going to destroy yourself again over that man   you re letting him make a fool of you again   who else will suffer this time   haven t you learned your lesson   he already left you once   he wouldn t have done so if you didn t talk to him   if you didn t scare him into thinking   that he would ruin my life   but don t worry   i won t let myself get fooled again   i won t let myself get destroyed again   i will not love tonio again   even if that s how i really feel   i will do that   not because i think it s wrong   or because i might get hurt again   i will do it   it s because   i don t want to give you more reason not to love me   i don t want another seven years to go by   that whenever you look at me  all you see are my mistakes   here  tonio  this will calm you   tonio  are you okay   are you feeling ill   maybe you shouldn t go to monica s party   mama mae  i have to   monica is expecting me   and i ve been waiting a long time for this   so why don t you look too happy   you look like you d rather go somewhere else   mama mae  monica is my girlfriend   i should be with her   it s why i changed  for her   as the saying goes   change is good as long as you change for the better   that s in english   this is what s right   this is what should be   you know  i admire your determination   to stay with monica   but if you re sticking to that   you might be stopping yourself   from experiencing the joy of true love   keep in mind  tonio   determination is not the same as love   hi  babe  you look great  mmm   stand up straight   how are you   um  are you ready   i want to introduce you to my friends   come on   anton  monica told me you plan to open a bar   have you picked out a location   we re still looking for a place where we   actually  anton is still doing his research   we already know that there s a lot of bars   that are open right now   so  we wanna make sure that his stands out   you know anton  he loves to take calculated risks   come on  anton  i know you worked abroad   so  i m sure you know about taking risks   yeah  in fact  i ve been to many countries   i started working as a   actually  anton has worked in so many places   when i met him  he was working for a big wine ranch in italy   and i thought he was done with it   but  you know   once a businessman always a businessman   actually  i m not sure if i m a good businessman at all    but you re right  but why   i m used to taking risks   that s what i did   when i jumped off a ship to become an illegal immigrant   oh  he was a seaman before   that s interesting   it was hard  but a lot of people helped me   that s why i have so much respect   for wealthy people like you   so when i got rich   i told myself that i should never feel ashamed   about where my money came from   because that was a blessing to me   a blessing given to me by a kind person   who accepted me for who i was   you re really lucky then   thank you for the wonderful evening   please  excuse me  i have to go   uh  excuse me  i ll be back    i think they re having a fight  okay   anton   anton   what was that all about   you humiliated me in front of my guests   i just defended myself   because i felt so small   i didn t embarrass you  monica   you embarrassed me   i was just protecting you from them   protecting me   why  because they re judgmental   they didn t even mind my bad english   and my being unsophisticated   but you did  monica   you think they weren t judging you   they were just being nice to you   but they were already judging you in their minds   but you re judging me to my face   you couldn t even let me speak for myself   because you re afraid everything i say will embarrass you   oh  my god   why are you being so juvenile about this   is this about stephanie again   steph has nothing to do with this   well  ever since you started working with her you ve changed   isn t that what you want that i change for you   you make it sound like change is such an awful thing  anton   tonio   my name is tonio   this isn t easy for me  tonio   this isn t easy for me either  monica   to admit that i m not enough   that i m so flawed in your eyes   the pain i feel right now is the same   as when my mother left me   the same pain i felt when i had to leave steph   because i felt that i wasn t good enough for her   because i love you   i let you change who i was   thinking that once i m finally a good fit for you   you might love me wholeheartedly   but now  i realize that will never happen   we will never be a good fit for each other   no matter how much i study english   no matter how hard i try to fit in with your friends   and no matter what clothes i wear   i m still nothing but trash to you   i m so tired  monica   are you saying that it s over   i m sorry   daddy   steph  come here   steph  it s okay   it s okay to get tired  to get hurt   it s even okay to make mistakes   but you also have to forgive yourself   daddy   daddy  i m so sorry   i m so sorry for what happened to you   steph   i never blamed you   nor does your mom   so stop thinking like that   she just doesn t want you to get hurt again   she knows that even though i got paralyzed   you re the one with the deeper wound   she just doesn t know how to help you   but  daddy   she still resents me for what happened   steph   steph  i m sorry   i didn t mean

   hey  everybody    yeah audience cheers and claps   yeah  this is the show   this is the show   so i got a question for you   does anyone out there have any cold war facts   of your own  that you would like to share   with us in this moment   we re obviously obsessed with this stuff   we could talk about it forever   but just wanna make sure i can open up the floor   to all of you   oh  i see a hand back there     anna  during the cold war   people were told to hide under their desks   students  just in case there was a nuclear bomb   they thought that would save them    oh  interesting    duck and cover  right    duck and cover  yeah   what s your name     anna  my name s anna    give it up for anna  anna    everybody audience cheers and claps   now  anna s really onto something here   it s true  it s true   uh  the government did actually write a song   promoting getting under your desk to kids   as if it was this  like  fun thing to do   and the song goes something like this    there was a turtle by the name of bert     and bert  that turtle  was very alert     when danger threatened him     he never got hurt     he knew just what to do     he d duck and cover     duck and cover    hey   so yeah  that s a real song   and it does not work  just in case you re wondering   but thank you  anna   thanks for that van laughs darkly   um  so  piggybacking off of  uh  that wonderful fact   we ve learned quite a bit of information   in our extensive research on wikipedia   the people s encyclopedia   just on the context for the space race   you know  why do these two countries come together   in this way  and that really begins in earnest   when  van    1940   the great purge   stalin was paranoid that everybody wanted to kill  im   which they did   so he was like   gather up anybody who might even seem   like a traitor   one million people were killed   five million went to prison   including the chief designer    stuck here     it s terrible    remember that song    i do audience laughing    all right    i do  van audience claps   uh  so while the chief designer was in the gulag   writing songs about dogs   world war ii was raging  right   and in 1941  the significance of that year   amongst many things   is that russia and america started out on opposite sides   but in june of  41  the nazis fucked over the soviets   which led the russians to run back to the allied forces   with their tails between their legs    now  we go to 1945  when   the allies win the war    hey audience cheers and claps    usa  450 000 casualties   ussr   24 million casualties   america thrives   russia is broken    mad  mad    these two allies start seeing things differently   they both want control of the world    and thus  a new war begins  and thus  a new war begins    only this war only  only this war only    took place behind  took place behind    closed doors  closed doors    now we go to 1951  where we get the first weightless dogs   i just did that

somebody is getting ordinary people   to do extraordinary things   things that nobody should be able to do   we have to stop whoever s behind this before someone else gets hurt    so you re the ones they re looking for  who are you talking about   smile   catherine  who d do that to somebody   i don t know  whoever it is  they just made us   we re screwed  the experiments were bad enough   but now that there are targets on our backs  i don t know   are you ready to do this  get married   glass breaks   come on  go   advertise your product or brand here contact www opensubtitles org today   that could ve left a mark   would ve served you right why are you sneaking up on me   i whistled  didn t you hear me whistle  it s our code  right   codes  we shouldn t need codes we should be getting married   planning our honeymoon not running for our lives   we re not running for our lives  we re just   we re buying time  okay until we can figure out how to    stop a superhuman assassin  yeah  that   we ve been on the run for three days  and somehow he keeps finding us    it s not looking good  well  he hasn t gotten us yet  has he   yeah  because he jumped through a stained glass window    and landed like a cat  mm hm  i can do that too    he has superhuman strength  well  i have super beast strength   bullets can t even stop him   he s got me there   this isn t a joke  vincent we re not moving forward   we re moving backward we re living in the shadows    just like you used to  yes  until you rescued me  right   yeah  but now we have to rescue each other   whoever is behind these experiments knows who we are now   that doesn t just put us in danger   it puts everyone we care about in danger too   which means he s not gonna stop coming after us until he succeeds   which is why we gotta put our focus back on whoever sent the guy  okay   cut the head off the snake stop them before they stop us   so we can finally get married   that s if you still want to get married   no  of course i want to get married   i love you  vincent you know that   it s just sometimes i wonder if it s ever really gonna happen   hamlin  this is detective hamlin   please  don t touch my things   that includes my gummy worms    forbes  hey  uh  can you talk   can you believe this guy    you on a burner phone  yeah  yeah  i am   what s going on  any problems   no  i like having roommates again  it s so not private   protective custody sucks   i m sorry  j t  we just can t take any chances   not for you  tess  heather   i know  i know  but i don t have to like it  do i   this is not the cop i want to be sleeping with   if you know what i mean   okay  well  as soon as we find out who s behind these experiments   the sooner we can get on with our lives   any progress   i ran genome sequencing on some of the outbreak victims   the ones that were enhanced by the parasite    okay  and  i identified   trace amounts of methyl aldehyde   in the delivery system aka formaldehyde   okay  i don t understand how does that help   distribution is highly regulated so not many labs are gonna have it   so if we can find the lab  we can figure out who s behind this   yeah  someone s gotta be making these highly complex serums  right    how many labs  j  t  uh  around 200   two hundred  are you kidding me  man  you gotta narrow it down   hey  give me a break don t you think i m trying   i don t have the processing capacity to do it here   and i can t very well sneak off to the university towing bodyguards   okay  i m sorry man  i m just   i m frustrated  and i m hungry  and i m cold   it s okay  i understand   wait  wait  doesn t the hospital have supercomputers   yeah  they do   but how are you gonna get in without somebody noticing   especially the guy who s trying to kill you   we gotta get out of here  come on   hello  vincent   you there   vincent   hello  vincent    what have we got  chemical accident  third degree burns    or s prepped and waiting  what  on whose order    dr  keller s  oh  keller  okay  fifth floor   thank you  fifth floor  gentlemen   clear   all right  i owe you guys  thanks   no way  you saved my son doc  you guys gonna be all right   yeah  we ll be okay   all right  take it easy  guys   let s go   okay   okay  hopefully i can access the mainframe from here   cross it over to j t  off site  so he can narrow down the list of labs   okay  i found a candy bar and an apple   living the dream i ll take the apple   oh  okay  here    any  uh  clean clothes in there  yeah  scrubs  blue   and hibiscus pink    no wedding dress or tux  by chance  no  sorry   you know  j t  was right  i mean  there are so many labs   this is gonna take days to narrow down   yeah  we don t have days neither do our friends and family    tess can t protect them forever  so  what are you suggesting   i m suggesting that we stop running  that we leave town   i hate to break it to you  but the assassin will keep following us   right  and if we draw him out  at least everyone else will be safe   and give j t  time to narrow down this list  and figure out who s behind it all   actually i m thinking that we can figure out who s behind this ourselves    by leaving town  by controlling the situation  yes   think about it  we ve been on the defensive   ever since his first attack  and it isn t working   we have gotta turn the tables  go on the offense   control where and when the next attack happens  surprise him for once   catherine  we re gonna need a pretty good reason to leave town   otherwise he s gonna think it s a trap   yeah  well  maybe we should elope   you gotta be kidding me  no   not actually elope  obviously just make him think that we are   we re barely one step ahead of him as it is   he s gonna believe that we re just taking off to elope   because he knows how desperate we are   he first attacked us in a church   maybe he thinks we re desperate to get married before he kills us   look  i don t know  i m just  i m tired  and i m hung   all screaming   growls   don t  someone might see you   alarm ringing   woman  all personnel we have a code silver   code silver  all hospital personnel   come on  we gotta stop him   that s it  we re definitely eloping   vincent  well    no sign of him  yet   don t forget to bring two forms of id  for the marriage license   right   come on  are you really serious about going through with this    do you have a better idea  than luring him out of town  no    but eloping  okay  it s just a ruse  vincent   it s a reason for us to get out of town so he doesn t think it s a trap   unless he thinks that s exactly what it is   but if he does  he s still gonna follow us   and we can control the where and the when   okay  but what if we actually have to go through with this   before he attacks us   then we do  don t forget a tie we need to make it look legit   okay  wait a minute  are you   are you completely okay with this    relax  i already told you  yeah  okay  i know it s a ruse   but it also sounds like you re okay with it if it s not   okay  i don t know if you re aware of this  vincent   but there is a superhuman assassin after us    can we talk about this later  no  no  we can t  okay   i don t want to elope   i want to get married the right way  the way we deserve   in front of friends and family   but we can t invite our friends and family   that s the whole point of us going to niagara falls  to protect them   i m not talking about the plan i am talking about our wedding   or at least the wedding that i thought we would have   vincent  it is just a ruse   okay  yes  but would you or wouldn t you be okay if it wasn t   i don t know  maybe   vincent  all i know is that i love you and i want to be your wife   and the sooner the better don t you want that too   yes  of course it is  okay  but   okay  the only way to do that is for us to get our lives back first   what are we gonna tell your sister or j t  or tess  for that matter   we are not going to tell them anything  we can t  for their own safety   especially tess  she s already risked too much   trying to get everybody police protection   i don t want her to get hurt helping us   okay   okay  i think we ve got everything are we doing this thing or not    i guess  vincent keller  i love you   and i don t need a piece of paper to prove it   but the bad guy might   all right  let us go and get our  happily ever after  back    the chief s still holding  all right  tell him i m in a meeting    that s what i told him last time  well    what are you doing here  oh  hey  sorry  i    i need a minute  but the chief sounds really upset    captain  i think he wants to  i know what he wants  i ll call back   if you re interested he wants to know   why i authorized the extra police protection   he wants to know what it s for   but i can t tell him  of course  because it s about all this superhuman crap   which brings me to  what the hell are you doing here   you re mad   oh  j t  see that s why i love you   you always pick up on the tiniest detail   i know  i m sorry   i m sorry  look  i m sorry  i just  i don t know how to juggle it all  okay   i am responsible for real cases  police cases    and i keep getting sidetracked by  formaldehyde    what  i think i just narrowed down   the list of labs for vincent   we re trying to backtrack who infected   all those innocent victims a few days ago   to try to find who s behind the experiments   not what i was talking about  but okay  hold on   are you using my security clearance to gain access to classified information   well  yeah  that s why i m here i couldn t do it from my place   certainly not with those thugs breathing down my neck   thugs  those are cops  j t   they re my cops  would ve been nice if you told me you were coming here   i could ve taken them off the clock  saved myself a little grief   well  hopefully it ll all be over with soon   gotta be one of these three labs   you re not even listening to me   huh  come on  a superhuman crazy   is trying to kill cat and vincent  and they need my help    what am i supposed to do  never mind   tess   what  cat and vincent are leaving   why  call heather  maybe she knows something   julianna  i see on your r sum you were working pr in the city   heather  pretty consistently  yes    and then you relocated to miami  briefly    and now you re back  permanently    yet no permanent address  oh  well  actually  i m in between   uh  ms  keaton  i know how it looks but  um  you can check my references   and they ll tell you that i m driven  i m dedicated   cell phone ringing   i m focused  and 100 percent ready   for this job   sorry  um  you can see on my r sum   that i assisted publicity for two of the largest firms on wall street   i also   cell phone ringing   i am really sorry  i don t know what s going on here   um  this is certainly not the norm   really  and are they part of the norm   that  no  they re temporary   my sister s a cop  and she s sort of going through this thing  and  um   cell phone beeps   i m sorry  ms  chandler  i ve heard good things about you   but i need someone who s a little less distracted   cat  it s your sister responding to your text message   which  aside from being rude because it was a group text   pretty much just cost me a job   or was it the goons who are shadowing me   because someone s after you   or maybe it was j t  and tess calling to see if i knew   why the hell you decided to bolt town without telling anyone first   as if that would make me worry about you any less  god   i didn t even get a chance to pitch my totally cool throwback idea   on mixing old hollywood and young hollywood pinups   to help them sell their cosmetic line to both demographics   but thanks to you  i   i m so sorry  i was just leaving   wait  that was actually an interesting pitch  the pinups idea   why didn t you tell me that in the first place   looks like he s taking the bait   man  it s me  looks like they re going to niagara falls   it could be a trap should i still follow   don t worry  i ll bring them back alive   wait  he s not trying to kill us   i know  might explain why we keep getting away from him   catherine  why would whoever s behind this want us back alive   vincent  i don t know but whatever the reason is   i think he knows it s a trap   look  maybe we should just head back  right   no  he s still following us  we stick to the plan   at least we know he s after us and not our friends   till death do us part  right   yeah  till death do us part   catherine  he could be here already   watching us  waiting to make his move   well  hopefully  he does before we elope    vincent  what  i don t have to like it  do i   we re not here to elope  we re here to trap the guy who s chasing us    protect our friends and family  by eloping   yes  and even if we have to go through with the ceremony   it doesn t have to count  not if we don t file the marriage certificate afterwards    are you completely sure about that  you are such a romantic   well  i m trying to be   woman  niagara falls marriage service hours are   okay  let s say he does fall for this ridiculous plan   how do we capture the guy    i m starting to think we don t have to  what   the more i think about it  the more i think we should let him catch us    that s what he wants anyway  right  yeah  what   so we make him think that he succeeded    something like that  yeah  and then what   okay  let s say he takes us back to whoever sent him   how do we get out of there  we saw what he can do with bullets    i hate to think what else he can do  yeah  but he hasn t seen   what you can do yet   for one reason or another every time that he s attacked   you haven t been able to beast out   so i say  let him bring us back to whoever s behind this   and then surprise   okay  you re banking a hell of a lot   on thinking that they don t know that i am a beast   we know that bob and carol didn t have a chance to tell them   so how could they know   next   welcome to the beginning of the rest of your lives    credit card or cash  uh  debit    alrighty  i need two forms of id  i got it   okay  fill these out  the spaces are marked in red   did you bring a witness    no  no   okay  that ll be 35 bucks extra   there you go  okay sign here and here   bring them back to me when you re done  next   touching   no  i understand your concerns  chief   but every person assigned a protective detail needs one  believe me   look  all due respect  sir   you gave me the job because you trusted my judgment   i m just asking you to trust it now thank you  sir  i won t let you down   if it s j t  tell him whether he likes it or not the detail stays   it s officer suarez  the detail assigned to heather chandler    is she all right  she s fine   but apparently she sent her detail away   insisted  apparently   what  i am putting my ass on the line to protect her  and    get her on the phone now  yeah   julianna  have you shared the good news with anybody yet   about the job  no   but i can t wait  my sister will be so surprised   cell phone ringing   i am so sorry  this um  won t happen again   now  we re going to have to talk about your security guards    because i can t have them  actually  i already sent them away   to prove to you that they are definitely not a part of my norm   great   so how is this building connected with the main office again   it s not  actually   so is this where you make your cosmetics   what are you doing  let go of me   what is going on   i need you to tell me who your sister s working for   what are you talking about   i want to know who your sister and her fianc  really are   and why they re after me   you re the one who s been after them   believe me  i don t want to hurt you  i don t want to hurt anybody   but sacrifices have to be made for the greater good   oh  you need to sign here  and there too    do i sign my maiden name  are you changing it   we haven t actually discussed that yet   then just sign your maiden name   you can always change it before you file your marriage certificate   right  which means it doesn t actually count  though  until we do  right   is he a foreigner   you know you can t marry him just to make him a citizen  you know that   it s against the law    that is not what s going on here  okay  good   all right  here you

leaving bread crumbs    or you re bad at covering your tracks  is everything okay    heather  okay  yes  yes   look  i can t really explain right now   but  well  everything s fine and we know what we re doing  right   really  because luring a superhuman assassin   sounds pretty insane right now   besides  why didn t you tell me   because we just wanted to keep you guys safe  okay   we didn t want you to follow us   so  what  eloping is your plan to lure him  come on  vincent  i know you    that s the last thing you d ever do  yeah  i know  i know  but   tell me you re not really gonna go through with it   that can t be the way you two get married   i ve already got my best man speech ready  it s memorized   okay  we re next  come on   the good news is that i think i might have found   the lab that made the serum and if so  then you won t have to    go through with any of this  are you sure    i ll know as soon as i go check it out  no  no   don t go on your own  it s too dangerous    just wait for us to get back  i can t  tess is totally pressuring me   besides  i need to show her why this is more important   than those damn police details she s so bent out of shape about    vincent  can  hear me    hello  you still there  j t   j  j t   if you can still hear me  i m heading to the lab  but don t tell tess    what are you doing  i got him   shouts   damn it  stop wait  i can explain   no  you know  maybe we should just let this couple go ahead of us   no  if he s watching us  we should make this look as real as possible   it s feeling pretty real to me right now   man  congratulations to you both   next  step on up   woman  congratulations  i  i can t    i can t do it  no  okay  come on  you have to   catherine chandler and vincent keller   that is us    okay  ready  sure   we are gathered here today to celebrate the union   of catherine chandler and vincent keller   today you arrived as individuals   but you will leave here as husband and wife   oh  catherine  i can t i can t do it  i can t do it   no  he might be watching us  vincent    problem  no   yes  yes  there is  this    this isn t right  vincent   i m sorry  i really am  i m sorry    excuse me  okay  we ll be right back   vincent    do you realize what you just did  yeah  i just stopped us from ruining   what should ve been the best day of our lives   no  you may have just ruined our best chance   to find out who s behind all this   and for what  because you don t want to elope   yes  yes  that is exactly why i did it   but we were never really going to do that   yes  we were  okay maybe not technically   but we were about to recite the vows  catherine   so what if we did  what difference does it make    it s just a piece of paper  no  no  it s not   okay  it s supposed to be one of the most important things   that we can do in our lives  okay   it s not us applying for some damn driver s license   we re getting married  okay  it shouldn t be some stupid ruse   i don t understand why you re acting this way   exactly  exactly  you don t  you don t understand   you know  that in there that may be enough for you   but that s not enough for me  okay   i want us to remember our wedding day just like my parents did   you know  the whole time i was growing up   that s all they ever spoke about   you know  their wedding like it was something magical   and i know it s corny  it is  but i want it to be magical for us too   i just  i can t believe that you don t   man  okay  nice big smiles  everybody   wedding march playing over speakers   catherine  catherine    that s close enough  okay  just don t hurt her  all right    tell us what you want  i want you to come with me   or your bride dies   okay  all right   all right   is this really necessary you re detaining me  really   j t  you tried to run away from your detail   i couldn t let them follow me  okay   i had to ditch them because i think i might have found   the lab behind all the experiments   so what  you can t pick up a phone and call me    you would ve let me go  to check out the lab by yourself  no   exactly  tess  you don t understand  this could be everything   if this lab s what i think it is  it can lead us right to whoever s behind it all   look  all i know is that i m risking my job to protect you   and you and everybody else are just trying to get rid of your protection   you don t think about how it reflects on me   you don t understand this could be it   we could be this close to solving all this superhuman crap   and getting it out of all of our lives once and for all    that s not what i m talking about  but that s all that matters right now   look  tess  don t worry   i already figured out how to get around lab security   so i can see what s really going on inside   without cat and vincent   yeah  but just to check it out until they get back  trust me  tess   this is important  i know what i m doing   you know what  j t  this is important too  and so is my job   doesn t it matter to you at all   of course it does  but i gotta do this  for cat and vincent    thanks for coming  we didn t have much of a choice   true   okay  you wanna tell us who you are   my name is julianna   but i m more interested in who you are and why you ve been trying to stop me   that s what we do stop people like you   you have no idea who i am   that s why we let your friend here capture us  to find out   growling   vincent    how d you know  that vincent s a beast   truth is  i should ve probably figured it out sooner   luckily  though  my new assistant came through   cat  i m sorry  cat   my sister has nothing to do with this  please  let her go   you need to start answering my questions  catherine   and tell me who you re really working for   i already told you  i work at the 125th  i m a detective in the n y p d   and vincent s just a doctor at new york general  clearly    what do you want me to say  i want you to say   how you were able to take down bob and carol hall   and how you subdued zane  alton   and all my other enhanced test subjects   except for him  he s a little more enhanced   you know who vincent really is you know what he s capable of    doesn t that answer your questions  it doesn t answer who sent you    or how he found out where i am  i don t know who you re talking about   shouts   no   no  please  stop   please  don t do this   that s enough   you re gonna tell me exactly where he s hiding   or we re gonna find out how much you re willing to see your fianc  suffer    j t  heather   they might hear you   what the hell is going on   i don t know  but they might kill them  we have to do something   what happened to you  are you okay   i don t know  i ve never been beaten up before    how did you know i was here  i didn t   i just came to see if this was the right lab  but what are you doing here   julianna tricked me   i thought i got a new job but she forced me to talk  i   i didn t mean to say anything   but they threatened to kill me and i didn t know what else to do   what do you mean what did you say   i told them about vincent about what he really is   what did they do to him   they shot him with the tranq gun before he could   here she comes  put your hands behind your back like they re still tied   door closes   julianna  if i m wrong  so  what are we gonna do   we gotta get vincent to wake up somehow  beast out   maybe find a little something to give him a boost   you are running out of time i am running out of patience   what is that   the enhancement serum you re familiar with   is the product of years of trial and error   all to try and stop the man who sent you   but this  this is a failed attempt   pushed the nervous system too far  caused a painful overdose   please  don t  i am telling you the truth   in a city of 8 million people   you zeroed in on my test subjects by chance  i don t think so   dhs knew about your experiments long before we did   we were just helping them    dhs hired a beast  really  yes  they did    what ll that do to him  hopefully  make him beast out    kick some ass  what s in it   a lot of things  epinephrine testosterone  steroids   it ll give vincent a hell of a jolt  that s for sure   we just need to find a delivery system   will this help   nice   who are you talking about  vincent   vincent  i m sorry  i don t know what to do   it s okay   no  it isn t  you have to wake up  you have to fight   you have to do everything you can  i can t lose you    i love you  no  vincent   last chance    what are you waiting for  shh  we only get one shot at this   please  you have to believe me we are not working for anyone    i don t know who you re talking about  wrong answer   growling   grunting and shouting   cat  don t   woman  dr  moline to oncology dr  moline to oncology  please    how is she  well  she s   she s in an induced coma until she can recover    will she recover  it s hard to say   look  catherine  it s not your fault  okay   she was gonna kill me  and after everything she s put us through   i know  i know  but there s supposed to be a difference   between people like her and people like us    i guess i just lost it  well  better you than me  right   do you believe what she was saying   that she did all this to stop somebody else   i don t know  i think that s more her problem than ours   besides  it s hard to believe that there is someone out there   that s worse than her   at least she won t be experimenting on innocents anymore    whatever the reason  well  that s all we set out to stop   when

s all right  i d rather not admit her as a jane doe   it s just kind of dicey with all the covering i ve done lately    yeah  i am so sorry  tess  no  no  no  don t apologize   it is what it is  and most importantly  you caught the big bad   well  actually  it was your boyfriend who helped us out    really  yeah   without j t  and heather we wouldn t have made it    vincent wouldn t be alive

tess  talk to me   look  j t  you saved the day   you know  you solved the grand mythological mystery   it s just that you didn t give a rat s ass about what i was going through   or what i needed    i m sorry  i  no  don t   look  tess  i admit  i   i was preoccupied with finding the guy   woman  as it turns out   behind it all   but it was worth it right  i was trying to help    i was trying to keep us safe  and you did   you did  and i m grateful  i really am  you did a good thing    so  what s the problem  i don t know   i don t know what the problem is  okay   maybe it s because you ve been helping vincent for years   maybe it s guilt because he s a beast  or loyalty to him  i don t know   but all i know is that you re not loyal to me  j t  at least not emotionally   and maybe  it is  it s selfish of me to want that  and if it is  so be it   but i want to be with someone who puts me first   who cares about what i need first   and that s not you   tess    i can t believe i

to know about the postcards 251 you need to face those emotions if you re ever going to overcome your trauma 252 that s just my opinion 253 i should give the doctor a call 254 lee sun ok  can you

make it to space   or even out of the atmosphere  for that matter    but  the flight showed that an animal could withstand   rocket conditions    success     nonetheless    i was the first to look into the cabin   tsygan and dezik   were alive   chief designer laughs   audience cheers and claps   i gave them sausage and water   i grabbed tsygan and ran around the yard   chief designer chuckles

you   does anyone out there have any cold war facts   of your own  that you would like to share   with us in this moment   we re obviously obsessed with this stuff   we could talk about it forever   but just wanna make sure i can open up the floor   to all of you   oh  i see a hand back there     anna  during the cold war   people were told to hide under their desks   students  just in case there was a nuclear bomb   they thought that would save them    oh  interesting    duck and cover  right    duck and cover  yeah   what s your name     anna  my name s anna    give it up for anna  anna    everybody audience cheers and claps   now  anna s really onto something here   it s true  it s true   uh  the government did actually write a song   promoting getting under your desk to kids   as if it was this  like  fun thing to do   and the song goes something like this    there was a turtle by the name of bert     and bert  that turtle  was very alert     when danger threatened him     he never got hurt     he knew just what to do     he d duck and cover     duck and cover    hey   so yeah  that s a real song   and it does not work  just in case you re wondering   but thank you  anna   thanks for that van laughs darkly   um  so  piggybacking off of  uh  that wonderful fact   we ve learned quite a bit of information   in our extensive research on wikipedia   the people s encyclopedia   just on the context for the space race   you know  why do these two countries come together   in this way  and that really begins in earnest   when  van    1940   the great purge   stalin was paranoid that everybody wanted to kill  im   which they did   so he was like   gather up anybody who might even seem   like a traitor   one million people were killed   five million went to prison   including the chief designer    stuck here     it s terrible    remember that song    i do audience laughing    all right    i do  van audience claps   uh  so while the chief designer was in the gulag   writing songs about dogs   world war ii was raging  right   and in 1941  the significance of that year   amongst many things   is that russia and america started out on opposite sides   but in june of  41  the nazis fucked over the soviets   which led the russians to run back to the allied forces   with their tails between their legs    now  we go to 1945  when   the allies win the war    hey audience cheers and claps    usa  450 000 casualties   ussr   24 million casualties   america thrives   russia is broken    mad  mad    these two allies start seeing things differently   they both want control of the world    and thus  a new war begins  and thus  a new war begins    only this war only  only this war only    took place behind  took place behind    closed doors  closed doors    now we go to 1951  where we get the first weightless dogs   i just did that part   i was standing right here   we remember that  right    yeah audience claps   tsygan and dezik    how are we feeling

we have to stop whoever s behind this before someone else gets hurt    so you re the ones they re looking for  who are you talking about   smile   catherine  who d do that to somebody   i don t know  whoever it is  they just made us   we re screwed  the experiments were bad enough   but now that there are targets on our backs  i don t know   are you ready to do this  get married   glass breaks   come on  go   advertise your product or brand here contact www opensubtitles org today   that could ve left a mark   would ve served you right why are you sneaking up on me   i whistled  didn t you hear me whistle  it s our code  right   codes  we shouldn t need codes we should be getting married   planning our honeymoon not running for our lives   we re not running for our lives  we re just   we re buying time  okay until we can figure out how to    stop a superhuman assassin  yeah  that   we ve been on the run for three days  and somehow he keeps finding us    it s not looking good  well  he hasn t gotten us yet  has he   yeah  because he jumped through a stained glass window    and landed like a cat  mm hm  i can do that too    he has superhuman strength  well  i have super beast strength   bullets can t even stop him   he s got me there   this isn t a joke  vincent we re not moving forward   we re moving backward we re living in the shadows    just like you used to  yes  until you rescued me  right   yeah  but now we have to rescue each other   whoever is behind these experiments knows who we are now   that doesn t just put us in danger   it puts everyone we care about in danger too   which means he s not gonna stop coming after us until he succeeds   which is why we gotta put our focus back on whoever sent the guy  okay   cut the head off the snake stop them before they stop us   so we can finally get married   that s if you still want to get married   no  of course i want to get married   i love you  vincent you know that   it s just sometimes i wonder if it s ever really gonna happen   hamlin  this is detective hamlin   please  don t touch my things   that includes my gummy worms    forbes  hey  uh  can you talk   can you believe this guy    you on a burner phone  yeah  yeah  i am   what s going on  any problems   no  i like having roommates again  it s so not private   protective custody sucks   i m sorry  j t  we just can t take any chances   not for you  tess  heather   i know  i know  but i don t have to like it  do i   this is not the cop i want to be sleeping with   if you know what i mean   okay  well  as soon as we find out who s behind these experiments   the sooner we can get on with our lives   any progress   i ran genome sequencing on some of the outbreak victims   the ones that were enhanced by the parasite    okay  and  i identified   trace amounts of methyl aldehyde   in the delivery system aka formaldehyde   okay  i don t understand how does that help   distribution is highly regulated so not many labs are gonna have it   so if we can find the lab  we can figure out who s behind this   yeah  someone s gotta be making these highly complex serums  right    how many labs  j  t  uh  around 200   two hundred  are you kidding me  man  you gotta narrow it down   hey  give me a break don t you think i m trying   i don t have the processing capacity to do it here   and i can t very well sneak off to the university towing bodyguards   okay  i m sorry man  i m just   i m frustrated  and i m hungry  and i m cold   it s okay  i understand   wait  wait  doesn t the hospital have supercomputers   yeah  they do   but how are you gonna get in without somebody noticing   especially the guy who s trying to kill you   we gotta get out of here  come on   hello  vincent   you there   vincent   hello  vincent    what have we got  chemical accident  third degree burns    or s prepped and waiting  what  on whose order    dr  keller s  oh  keller  okay  fifth floor   thank you  fifth floor  gentlemen   clear   all right  i owe you guys  thanks   no way  you saved my son doc  you guys gonna be all right   yeah  we ll be okay   all right  take it easy  guys   let s go   okay   okay  hopefully i can access the mainframe from here   cross it over to j t  off site  so he can narrow down the list of labs   okay  i found a candy bar and an apple   living the dream i ll take the apple   oh  okay  here    any  uh  clean clothes in there  yeah  scrubs  blue   and hibiscus pink    no wedding dress or tux  by chance  no  sorry   you know  j t  was right  i mean  there are so many labs   this is gonna take days to narrow down   yeah  we don t have days neither do our friends and family    tess can t protect them forever  so  what are you suggesting   i m suggesting that we stop running  that we leave town   i hate to break it to you  but the assassin will keep following us   right  and if we draw him out  at least everyone else will be safe   and give j t  time to narrow down this list  and figure out who s behind it all   actually i m thinking that we can figure out who s behind this ourselves    by leaving town  by controlling the situation  yes   think about it  we ve been on the defensive   ever since his first attack  and it isn t working   we have gotta turn the tables  go on the offense   control where and when the next attack happens  surprise him for once   catherine  we re gonna need a pretty good reason to leave town   otherwise he s gonna think it s a trap   yeah  well  maybe we should elope   you gotta be kidding me  no   not actually elope  obviously just make him think that we are   we re barely one step ahead of him as it is   he s gonna believe that we re just taking off to elope   because he knows how desperate we are   he first attacked us in a church   maybe he thinks we re desperate to get married before he kills us   look  i don t know  i m just  i m tired  and i m hung   all screaming   growls   don t  someone might see you   alarm ringing   woman  all personnel we have a code silver   code silver  all hospital personnel   come on  we gotta stop him   that s it  we re definitely eloping   vincent  well    no sign of him  yet   don t forget to bring two forms of id  for the marriage license   right   come on  are you really serious about going through with this    do you have a better idea  than luring him out of town  no    but eloping  okay  it s just a ruse  vincent   it s a reason for us to get out of town so he doesn t think it s a trap   unless he thinks that s exactly what it is   but if he does  he s still gonna follow us   and we can control the where and the when   okay  but what if we actually have to go through with this   before he attacks us   then we do  don t forget a tie we need to make it look legit   okay  wait a minute  are you   are you completely okay with this    relax  i already told you  yeah  okay  i know it s a ruse   but it also sounds like you re okay with it if it s not   okay  i don t know if you re aware of this  vincent   but there is a superhuman assassin after us    can we talk about this later  no  no  we can t  okay   i don t want to elope   i want to get married the right way  the way we deserve   in front of friends and family   but we can t invite our friends and family   that s the whole point of us going to niagara falls  to protect them   i m not talking about the plan i am talking about our wedding   or at least the wedding that i thought we would have   vincent  it is just a ruse   okay  yes  but would you or wouldn t you be okay if it wasn t   i don t know  maybe   vincent  all i know is that i love you and i want to be your wife   and the sooner the better don t you want that too   yes  of course it is  okay  but   okay  the only way to do that is for us to get our lives back first   what are we gonna tell your sister or j t  or tess  for that matter   we are not going to tell them anything  we can t  for their own safety   especially tess  she s already risked too much   trying to get everybody police protection   i don t want her to get hurt helping us   okay   okay  i think we ve got everything are we doing this thing or not    i guess  vincent keller  i love you   and i don t need a piece of paper to prove it   but the bad guy might   all right  let us go and get our  happily ever after  back    the chief s still holding  all right  tell him i m in a meeting    that s what i told him last time  well    what are you doing here  oh  hey  sorry  i    i need a minute  but the chief sounds really upset    captain  i think he wants to  i know what he wants  i ll call back   if you re interested he wants to know   why i authorized the extra police protection   he wants to know what it s for   but i can t tell him  of course  because it s about all this superhuman crap   which brings me to  what the hell are you doing here   you re mad   oh  j t  see that s why i love you   you always pick up on the tiniest detail   i know  i m sorry   i m sorry  look  i m sorry  i just  i don t know how to juggle it all  okay   i am responsible for real cases  police cases    and i keep getting sidetracked by  formaldehyde    what  i think i just narrowed down   the list of labs for vincent   we re trying to backtrack who infected   all those innocent victims a few days ago   to try to find who s behind the experiments   not what i was talking about  but okay  hold on   are you using my security clearance to gain access to classified information   well  yeah  that s why i m here i couldn t do it from my place   certainly not with those thugs breathing down my neck   thugs  those are cops  j t   they re my cops  would ve been nice if you told me you were coming here   i could ve taken them off the clock  saved myself a little grief   well  hopefully it ll all be over with soon   gotta be one of these three labs   you re not even listening to me   huh  come on  a superhuman crazy   is trying to kill cat and vincent  and they need my help    what am i supposed to do  never mind   tess   what  cat and vincent are leaving   why  call heather  maybe she knows something   julianna  i see on your r sum you were working pr in the city   heather  pretty consistently  yes    and then you relocated to miami  briefly    and now you re back  permanently    yet no permanent address  oh  well  actually  i m in between   uh  ms  keaton  i know how it looks but  um  you can check my references   and they ll tell you that i m driven  i m dedicated   cell phone ringing   i m focused  and 100 percent ready   for this job   sorry  um  you can see on my r sum   that i assisted publicity for two of the largest firms on wall street   i also   cell phone ringing   i am really sorry  i don t know what s going on here   um  this is certainly not the norm   really  and are they part of the norm   that  no  they re temporary   my sister s a cop  and she s sort of going through this thing  and  um   cell phone beeps   i m sorry  ms  chandler  i ve heard good things about you   but i need someone who s a little less distracted   cat  it s your sister responding to your text message   which  aside from being rude because it was a group text   pretty much just cost me a job   or was it the goons who are shadowing me   because someone s after you   or maybe it was j t  and tess calling to see if i knew   why the hell you decided to bolt town without telling anyone first   as if that would make me worry about you any less  god   i didn t even get a chance to pitch my totally cool throwback idea   on mixing old hollywood and young hollywood pinups   to help them sell their cosmetic line to both demographics   but thanks to you  i   i m so sorry  i was just leaving   wait  that was actually an interesting pitch  the pinups idea   why didn t you tell me that in the first place   looks like he s taking the bait   man  it s me  looks like they re going to niagara falls   it could be a trap should i still follow   don t worry  i ll bring them back alive   wait  he s not trying to kill us   i know  might explain why we keep getting away from him   catherine  why would whoever s behind this want us back alive   vincent  i don t know but whatever the reason is   i think he knows it s a trap   look  maybe we should just head back  right   no  he s still following us  we stick to the plan   at least we know he s after us and not our friends   till death do us part  right   yeah  till death do us part   catherine  he could be here already   watching us  waiting to make his move   well  hopefully  he does before we elope    vincent  what  i don t have to like it  do i   we re not here to elope  we re here to trap the guy who s chasing us    protect our friends and family  by eloping   yes  and even if we have to go through with the ceremony   it doesn t have to count  not if we don t file the marriage certificate afterwards    are you completely sure about that  you are such a romantic   well  i m trying to be   woman  niagara falls marriage service hours are   okay  let s say he does fall for this ridiculous plan   how do we capture the guy    i m starting to think we don t have to  what   the more i think about it  the more i think we should let him catch us    that s what he wants anyway  right  yeah  what   so we make him think that he succeeded    something like that  yeah  and then what   okay  let s say he takes us back to whoever sent him   how do we get out of there  we saw what he can do with bullets    i hate to think what else he can do  yeah  but he hasn t seen   what you can do yet   for one reason or another every time that he s attacked   you haven t been able to beast out   so i say  let him bring us back to whoever s behind this   and then surprise   okay  you re banking a hell of a lot   on thinking that they don t know that i am a beast   we know that bob and carol didn t have a chance to tell them   so how could they know   next   welcome to the beginning of the rest of your lives    credit card or cash  uh  debit    alrighty  i need two forms of id  i got it   okay  fill these out  the spaces are marked in red   did you bring a witness    no  no   okay  that ll be 35 bucks extra   there you go  okay sign here and here   bring them back to me when you re done  next   touching   no  i understand your concerns  chief   but every person assigned a protective detail needs one  believe me   look  all due respect  sir   you gave me the job because you trusted my judgment   i m just asking you to trust it now thank you  sir  i won t let you down   if it s j t  tell him whether he likes it or not the detail stays   it s officer suarez  the detail assigned to heather chandler    is she all right  she s fine   but apparently she sent her detail away   insisted  apparently   what  i am putting my ass on the line to protect her  and    get her on the phone now  yeah   julianna  have you shared the good news with anybody yet   about the job  no   but i can t wait  my sister will be so surprised   cell phone ringing   i am so sorry  this um  won t happen again   now  we re going to have to talk about your security guards    because i can t have them  actually  i already sent them away   to prove to you that they are definitely not a part of my norm   great   so how is this building connected with the main office again   it s not  actually   so is this where you make your cosmetics   what are you doing  let go of me   what is going on   i need you to tell me who your sister s working for   what are you talking about   i want to know who your sister and her fianc  really are   and why they re after me   you re the one who s been after them   believe me  i don t want to hurt you  i don t want to hurt anybody   but sacrifices have to be made for the greater good   oh  you need to sign here  and there too    do i sign my maiden name  are you changing it   we haven t actually discussed that yet   then just sign your maiden name   you can always change it before you file your marriage certificate   right  which means it doesn t actually count  though  until we do  right   is he a foreigner   you know you can t marry him just to make him a citizen  you know that   it s against the law    that is not what s going on here  okay  good   all right  here you go  just line up over there and wait till your name s called   thank you  okay  next    what s going on with you  i just  i asked a question    why are you acting so weird  i m not   come on   cell phone ringing   wait  hey  j t what s going on    tell me you re not eloping  no  no  not really   okay  how do you know   debit card  wedding kiosk  niagara falls   either you re intentionally leaving bread crumbs    or you re bad at covering your tracks  is everything okay    heather  okay  yes  yes   look  i can t really explain right now   but  well  everything s fine and we know what we re doing  right   really  because luring a superhuman assassin   sounds pretty insane right now   besides  why didn t you tell me   because we just wanted to keep you guys safe  okay   we didn t want you to follow us   so  what  eloping is your plan to lure him  come on  vincent  i know you    that s the last thing you d ever do  yeah  i know  i know  but   tell me you re not really gonna go through with it   that can t be the way you two get married   i ve already got my best man speech ready  it s memorized   okay  we re next  come on   the good news is that i think i might have found   the lab that made the serum and if so  then you won t have to    go through with any of this  are you sure    i ll know as soon as i go check it out  no  no   don t go on your own  it s too dangerous    just wait for us to get back  i can t  tess is totally pressuring me   besides  i need to show her why this is more important   than those damn police details she s so bent out of shape about    vincent  can  hear me    hello  you still there  j t   j  j t   if you can still hear me  i m heading to the lab  but don t tell tess    what are you doing  i got him   shouts   damn it  stop wait  i can explain   no  you know  maybe we should just let this couple go ahead of us   no  if he s watching us  we should make this look as real as possible   it s feeling pretty real to me right now   man  congratulations to you both   next  step on up   woman  congratulations  i  i can t    i can t do it  no  okay  come on  you have to   catherine chandler and vincent keller   that is us    okay  ready  sure   we are gathered here today to celebrate the union   of catherine chandler and vincent keller   today you arrived as individuals   but you will leave here as husband and wife   oh  catherine  i can t i can t do it  i can t do it   no  he might be watching us  vincent    problem  no   yes  yes  there is  this    this isn t right  vincent   i m sorry  i really am  i m sorry    excuse me  okay  we ll be right back   vincent    do you realize what you just did  yeah  i just stopped us from ruining   what should ve been the best day of our lives   no  you may have just ruined our best chance   to find out who s behind all this   and for what  because you don t want to elope   yes  yes  that is exactly why i did it   but we were never really going to do that   yes  we were  okay maybe not technically   but we were about to recite the vows  catherine   so what if we did  what difference does it make    it s just a piece of paper  no  no  it s not   okay  it s supposed to be one of the most important things   that we can do in our lives  okay   it s not us applying for some damn driver s license   we re getting married  okay  it shouldn t be some stupid ruse   i don t understand why you re acting this way   exactly  exactly  you don t  you don t understand   you know  that in there that may be enough for you   but that s not enough for me  okay   i want us to remember our wedding day just like my parents did   you know  the whole time i was growing up   that s all they ever spoke about   you know  their wedding like it was something magical   and i know it s corny  it is  but i want it to be magical for us too   i just  i can t believe that you don t   man  okay  nice big smiles  everybody   wedding march playing over speakers   catherine  catherine    that s close enough  okay  just don t hurt her  all right    tell us what you want  i want you to come with me   or your bride dies   okay  all right   all right   is this really necessary you re detaining me  really   j t  you tried to run away from your detail   i couldn t let them follow me  okay   i had to ditch them because i think i might have found   the lab behind all the experiments   so what  you can t pick up a phone and call me    you would ve let me go  to check out the lab by yourself  no   exactly  tess  you don t understand  this could be everything   if this lab s what i think it is  it can lead us right to whoever s behind it all   look  all i know is that i m risking my job to protect you   and you and everybody else are just trying to get rid of your protection   you don t think about how it reflects on me   you don t understand this could be it   we could be this close to solving all this superhuman crap   and getting it out of all of our lives once and for all    that s not what i m talking about  but that s all that matters right now   look  tess  don t worry   i already figured out how to get around lab security   so i can see what s really going on inside   without cat and vincent   yeah  but just to check it out until they get back  trust me  tess   this is important  i know what i m doing   you know what  j t  this is important too  and so is my job   doesn t it matter to you at all   of course it does  but i gotta do this  for cat and vincent    thanks for coming  we didn t have much of a choice   true   okay  you wanna tell us who you are   my name is julianna   but i m more interested in who you are and why you ve been trying to stop me   that s what we do stop people like you   you have no idea who i am   that s why we let your friend here capture us  to find out   growling   vincent    how d you know  that vincent s a beast   truth is  i should ve probably figured it out sooner   luckily  though  my new assistant came through   cat  i m sorry  cat   my sister has nothing to do with this  please  let her go   you need to start answering my questions  catherine   and tell me who you re really working for   i already told you  i work at the 125th  i m a detective in the n y p d   and vincent s just a doctor at new york general  clearly    what do you want me to say  i want you to say   how you were able to take down bob and carol hall   and how you subdued zane  alton   and all my other enhanced test subjects   except for him  he s a little more enhanced   you know who vincent really is you know what he s capable of    doesn t that answer your questions  it doesn t answer who sent you    or how he found out where i am  i don t know who you re talking about   shouts   no   no  please  stop   please  don t do this   that s enough   you re gonna tell me exactly where he s hiding   or we re gonna find out how much you re willing to see your fianc  suffer    j t  heather   they might hear you   what the hell is going on   i don t know  but they might kill them  we have to do something   what happened to you  are you okay   i don t know  i ve never been beaten up before    how did you know i was here  i didn t   i just came to see if this was the right lab  but what are you doing here   julianna tricked me   i thought i got a new job but she forced me to talk  i   i didn t mean to say anything   but they threatened to kill me and i didn t know what else to do   what do you mean what did you say   i told them about vincent about what he really is   what did they do to him   they shot him with the tranq gun before he could   here she comes  put your hands behind your back like they re still tied   door closes   julianna  if i m wrong  so  what are we gonna do   we gotta get vincent to wake up somehow  beast out   maybe find a little something to give him a boost   you are running out of time i am running out of patience   what is that   the enhancement serum you re familiar with   is the product of years of trial and error   all to try and stop the man who sent you   but this  this is a failed attempt   pushed the nervous system too far  caused a painful overdose   please  don t  i am telling you the truth   in a city of 8 million people   you zeroed in on my test subjects by chance  i don t think so   dhs knew about your experiments long before we did   we were just helping them    dhs hired a beast  really  yes  they did    what ll that do to him  hopefully  make him beast out    kick some ass  what s in it   a lot of things  epinephrine testosterone  steroids   it ll give vincent a hell of a jolt  that s for sure   we just need to find a delivery system   will this help   nice   who are you talking about  vincent   vincent  i m sorry  i don t know what to do   it s okay   no  it isn t  you have to wake up  you have to fight   you have to do everything you can  i can t lose you    i love you  no  vincent   last chance    what are you waiting for  shh  we only get one shot at this   please  you have to believe me we are not working for anyone    i don t know who you re talking about  wrong answer   growling   grunting and shouting   cat  don t   woman  dr  moline to oncology dr  moline to oncology  please    how is she  well  she s   she s in an induced coma until she can recover    will she recover  it s hard to say   look  catherine  it s not your fault  okay   she was gonna kill me  and after everything she s put us through   i know  i know  but there s supposed to be a difference   between people like her and people like us    i guess i just lost it  well  better you than me  right   do you believe what she was saying   that she did all this to stop somebody else   i don t know  i think that s more her problem than ours   besides  it s hard to believe that there is someone out there   that s worse than her   at least she won t be experimenting on innocents anymore    whatever the reason  well  that s all we set out to stop   when this first started  right    you guys okay  can we get back to you on that   yeah  hey  how long do you think we can keep her on the jail ward for    hey  you re the doctor  you tell me  okay   if it s all right  i d rather not admit her as a jane doe   it s just kind of dicey with all the covering i ve done lately    yeah  i am so sorry  tess  no  no  no  don t apologize   it is what it is  and most importantly  you caught the big bad   well  actually  it was your boyfriend who helped us out    really  yeah   without j t  and heather we wouldn t have made it    vincent wouldn t be alive  yeah  well  i m not surprised   j t  always comes through for vincent   no matter what   hey  no need to apologize   and you can hold the congratulations  it was a team effort    what s going on  i really love this sweatshirt    yeah  i noticed  that s hard to believe   well  you sleep in it almost every night   and i love to see you in it  it looks good on you   where are you going with this  tess  talk to me   look  j t  you saved the day   you know  you solved the grand mythological mystery   it s just that you didn t give a rat s ass about what i was going through   or what i needed    i m sorry  i  no  don t   look  tess  i admit  i   i was preoccupied with finding the guy   woman  as it turns out   behind it all   but it was worth it right  i was trying to help    i was trying to keep us safe  and you did   you did  and i m grateful  i really am  you did a good thing    so  what s the problem  i don t know   i don t know what the problem is  okay   maybe it s because you ve been helping vincent for years   maybe it s guilt because he s a beast  or loyalty to him  i don t know   but all i know is that you re not loyal to me  j t  at least not emotionally   and maybe  it is  it s selfish of me to want that  and if it is  so be it   but i want to be with someone

words no one speaks to me like that   you re playing with fire then get out  or you ll get burned   what s going on in here   to call helena a murderer in public   aren t you ashamed of threatening bia with that   why would he  it s the truth   because she s guilty of everything   paula manuel   paula  please hear me out   you re either with this family or the urquiza family   let s all calm down   think about what i just said   excuse her this thing s got her stressed out   i don t know why she s against me she s not   be patient with her  she s still getting over what happened   that s what i thought at first but i m not sure anymore   does she really not have a problem with me   manuel  paula has nothing against you   it s this situation with the urquizas  really   hmm    ta da  ah  you re such a doll   you looked so focused i thought a cup of tea would help    thank you  cheers    how are you  me  same as always  working a lot   one day  it will be my turn you have to start

i m just a little tired   ah  i love those bracelets is this a new one   um  yeah  it s new   if you want  i ll take you to the store where they sell them   and jhon  you were telling me earlier   yes  the message  want to hear it again   that s not necessary  i remember it you re going together to laix s party   together   and what s weird about it i don t know  together as what   ah   i get it  the thing is you don t know exactly what that means   yeah  together as friends as a couple  as what   i think you shouldn t label it do you have fun with him   lots of fun   when you say goodbye to him do you want to see him again   i never want to say goodbye   then it doesn t matter if you re a couple or not   yeah  in theory  that s fine but in reality  i need to know   i get you may be able to connect with a guy in an ambiguous way   what do you mean   no  nothing  i don t know what to do   i think you should ask him   of course   of course  i have to ask him   that s it   alex s been offline for hours   if he won t answer you he definitely won t answer me   find him  i want him here asap he s not here   he s not  i just went there   he won t answer  he s gone he vanished into thin air   i don t know  but he ll hear me out   he doesn t know what s coming   i can t believe her  who does she think she is  bursting in that way   find out what she said to marcos  now sure   i now need to focus on myself think of my outfit   i need to rehearse with alex for the party  carmilex   carmilex will rock   did you forgive alex for stealing the charity video idea   i thought look  he meant well   but okay   that s relationships for you  mara   you ll understand when you have a boyfriend   sure yeah  don t worry   with a little luck or maybe lots of luck in your case   someday  you ll find someone for you  maybe   what are you waiting for  go get my accessories  i ll decide what to wear   uh  sure sure  quick  mara   hurry yeah   so  did you understand the question um  can you repeat it   yes  what does it mean going together to laix s party   i don t get what you don t understand about going together   because there s together and together   it sounds the same to me   yeah  but to me it means two different things   i need to know which one it is   uh  the first one  yeah  that one   now that we ve cleared that up let s talk about valeria   we need to make a plan i m almost sure she s the cobra   you were sure i was too  and i m not we need evidence   i know  what if we tell each other something private  so she can listen   that s great really   yes  we can tell each other a secret when she s near  listening   and if cobra posts it   if she does we catch the snake   yes   i m sick of this   relax you re telling me to relax   you re the one who almost got into a fight with alex at dinner   how did we end up like this   i m asking myself the same thing how did we end up like this   but i can assure you they won t stop me from doing moondust s album   marcelo told me he s setting up a band   and he needs a guitarist    what  i can t believe this   i think it s a good idea   i can t believe marcelo asked you to convince me to play again   i don t know what you re talking about   manuel  you might be a great musician   but you should learn acting if you want to lie to me   marcelo didn t ask me anything stop it  it s impossible   don t say that   i can t   i can t play again   what s wrong nothing  i was just thinking   you know when you find out something you didn t expect   what did you find out nothing  it s just occurred to me   it did   yeah  you know when you know someone   who s doing something and you don t get why they re doing it   no i m lost  what are we talking about   we re talking about secrets from friends   a friend who won t tell you her secret   sure  if someone has a secret and they won t tell you   you should respect that  right   yes  of course  but sometimes sometimes  what    tell me  girls  congratulations   what this duet will rock the cyber gold party   we are yes  i just talked to marcos   wait  to marcos golden yes  i went to laix and talked to him   i also had a little argument with carm n but then he saw me   and assured me we don t need to worry about alex   yes  bia  you re amazing    yes  amazing   guys  we re going to sing yes   everyone will watch  we ll get calls from everywhere  this will be amazing   all right  one step at a time   first  we need to rehearse yes  you just need to enjoy it now   and we need to thank you if it weren t for you  we wouldn t do it   no need  i d do anything for you guys   wait  guys  what will happen with alex   don t worry  marcos will handle it   what s up  marcos you left a million messages   what s up   you disrespected my authority what   you threatened bia and her friends so they wouldn t sing   ah  that s what the fuss is all about   i m warning you  alex  threaten her again and you re out of laix   i m the one setting trends here haven t you heard   i have my own ideas too your own what   ideas of my own this is laix   now you re laix  and laix is me is that clear   i m still alex don t kid yourself  marcos   you think you can do whatever you want here   i m an artist  laix needs me here do you know what laix needs   no laix needs whatever i say   do you know what i say   i say you won t sing at cyber gold what   we regret to announce  i m alex  won t be at cyber gold due to scheduling issues   hashtag   show must go on   you ll leave out one of your most important influencers   because of two newbies   you re far from being important   besides  you didn t understand   this isn t for bia  chiara and celeste this is to teach you a lesson   you re making a mistake  marcos   i lifted you up  and i can make you fall    what s going on here  change of plans  carm n   you ll sing alone at the party why   i m sorry  i m exhausted   alex won t sing that s all you need to know   what  no   i don t understand  what happened   because of what i told bia i don t know who told him    i do  bia talked to him  what   yes  yesterday  she came to laix and talked to marcos   i m sure she told him to get you out   this isn t the end of this

for men when their women make the big bucks   i went through the same thing with jillian   you know  it s   i was an idiot for a while  but then   eventually  i got over it   i don t know if i can hang in there long enough   for him to work through this   if he ever does   why don t you go see a counselor   yeah  right   he d never agree to that   it gets ugly sometimes   you guys are good

palm beach  they   pick you to work this case   luck of the draw  i guess   well  shouldn t you disqualify yourself   for your personal involvement   you watch too much tv  jeff   come by to soothe your guilty conscience  huh   come on  jeff   leave it alone   it s all right   i feel terrible about what happened to tina   the only thing i can do is find out who killed her   and i need your help

hey   i taught  em everything i know   you taught  em everything you know   careful don t let  em hear that   yeah   listen  rick  i want to talk to you about something   but you gotta  you gotta promise not to punch me out   oh  you re not going to come on to me  are you   not in my worst nightmare   good   then fire away   yeah   look  uh  everything cool with you and liz   sure   why do you ask   just thought i picked up a vibe between the two of you   the other day   well  maybe you re  uh   maybe you re being overly sensitive   yeah   yeah  maybe  but  look  i think i know what s going   see  i happen to be involved with a woman whose income makes   mine look like pocket change   so   what s your point   well  just   i had to realize i was never going to match up in the cash   department  but that i had some other things   to offer that money can t buy   a manly physique   no  definitely  but   but some other things  too   yeah  well  it s a little different when you re married   come on  man   it can t be that different   sure it is   when you realize that your wife is going to make more in a week   than you do in an entire year   it s not until things change  or for now   so what   so it s a hard fact to swallow   what about the fact that liz is going   to love you no matter what   yeah   for how long   don t kid yourself  man   money matters   it s this invisible yardstick that people   always use to measure the guy standing in front of you   nobody will admit to it  or talk about it   so don t kid yourself   it s always there   i can t believe you  man   come on   in college  you were always the idealist   when did money start meaning so much to you   when i left school  and i woke up in the real world   and my wife started leaving me behind   that s not the way it is   how long before she starts comparing   me to the men in her world  and she   sees that i don t measure up   a month   a year   with liz   i d say it ll be forever   nothing is forever   oh  ok  so that means i have the rest of my life to wonder   when she s going to bail on me   this is no way to live  man   i think you oughta talk to somebody   you know  what  don t you have   anything else better to do  than poke your face into my life   yeah   yeah   uh  forget it   sorry   that s it   mm   that s it   let dr  jeff rid of all that tension   just let it melt away  under my hands   i m going to make you forget everything   it s ok   it s ok   it s ok   it s ok   just let it all out   let it all out   let it all out   yes   i know what scares you   what   what did you say   uh   what did you say   it was  it was just a joke   a little twist on the heat   no  it was beyond sick   totally nuts   i m sorry   i didn t mean anything by it   now  you gotta believe me  no   get away from me   get away from me   i want you to leave right now   get out   no  no  get away from me   alexa  don t treat me this way   don t   alexa   please   don t do this

partner   this is  this is rita lance   hi   i m real sorry about your friend   um  we kind of got off to a bad start   don t worry about it   um  i m real confused   something really weird happened last night   and i don t know who to talk to   you can talk to us   i don t know   i m probably overreacting   what s on your mind   i was with jeff last night  and we   were making love  and he   he  he put his hand over my mouth  and he said   i know what scares you   just like the guy on the phone   exactly like the guy on the phone   you know  maybe he was joking  but it was so sick   so then what happened   i freaked   i locked myself in the bathroom i told him to get out  and   i don t know   just  the way that he said it   i was scared   i told him to get out but he hung around   until 4 00 in the morning   i don t know   i think i overreacted   no  you didn t   you just lost your best friend   what jeff did was not funny   you had every right to react that way   do you think jeff could ve had anything   to do with these phone calls   i  i don t know how   i mean  the last couple of times the guy called   jeff was with me   yeah  like the other afternoon   i was there  too   i just have this   creepy feeling   like  like it can t be him  but maybe it is   i don t know   so how much do you know about jeff s past   um  he s   he s from a rich family from virginia   his mother s dead  and his   his dad s in europe a lot on business   i don t know   jeff s not real talkative on that subject   do you know where jeff was the night that tina was murdered   well  he  he said that he was at the movies   you know  that old art house on baker street   he goes there a lot   at least  that s what he told me   you got a picture of jeff   oh   yeah   short  dirty blonde hair   tina  is there a place you can stay for a couple of days   at least till we check this guy out   yeah   my parents  house  i guess   ok   why don t you do that   i ll get the phone number on the way

gigantic picture window   what do you think   i think if it makes you happy  it s ok by me   that s it   that s your reaction   this is our dream house   no  this is your dream house   let s see  i can contribute about   1 10 the cost of this house   i ll tell you what  maybe i can go for the guest bathroom   that s what i could  no no  you go with the fixtures   i can t do that   let s go with the chimney   that s what i could afford   you re being ridiculous   no i m not  liz   i can t compete in your world anymore   i never asked you to   here we go   poor rick   don t you get bored feeling sorry for yourself   i know i sure as hell do   i love you   and i know you love me   why isn t that enough anymore   you recognize him   sure  i know this guy   he s in here all the time   seems like a nice guy   kind of goofy sometimes   in what way   oh  you know  he s always got some dumb comment   about the movies   like i m the one that decides what we show   or like  the film s scratched  or something   i mean  what does he expect   we show old movies here   right   was he in here the night before last   say  between 10 00 and midnight   let s see  what were we showing   oh  yeah  it was hitchcock night   10 00 show   psycho   he was definitely here   you sure about that   yeah  he loves that one   i don t like the scary ones  so he   teases me about it sometimes   he tease you that night   yeah   he filled his mouth full of ketchup and made a scary face   and let it drip down his chin   like  i m so terrified  right   what a kidder   well  he s kind of goofy  like i said   so he was in here at 10 00   you happen to see him leave   no   oh  i had to work the box office   we were showing the  rocky horror   picture show  at midnight   it gets really crazy   of course  he could have gone out the back exit   thanks   yeah  what was the disposition on that one   uh huh   great   ok   anything else   ok  thanks   well  you will never guess what i got   mr  priot s a mile long on jeff chadwick   yeah  pretty much   how did you know   that s what any good partner would ve done   mm   hasn t been in any trouble since the family moved to florida   but has been in and out of psychiatric treatment   and was quite the probation poster   boy back home in virginia   why doesn t that surprise me   listen to this   trespassing  fined and released   breaking and entering case dismissed   vandalism  father paid restitution  charges dropped   expelled from blackport school in richmond   for stalking and threatening a female teacher   later arrested for violating a restraining   order in connection with the same teacher   placed on probation   none of the cases ever went to trial   the kid never served a day in jail   might be time to change all that   why   what did you get   i talked to a witness who can place   him at the theater at 10  the night of the murder   not one person saw him leave   ah   which still leaves the time of the murder unaccounted for   i say we pick him up  run it by him   no  no  no  no   the only thing we have to tie this kid to the murder   is a piece of hearsay from a hysterical witness   who was in a state of

it s a cellular number   you know  he could be rounding the call   through his cellular phone and call forwarding it   to another number from there   does that make him harder to trace   almost impossible   unless you caught him in the act   here s several calls scheduled to the same number today   in fact  there s one programmed for a couple minutes   from now   we ve configured it for an intercept   if he s using call forwarding  the end number   will come up in our computer   liz   rick  i am so glad you re home   what s going on   i tried to call you from the car  and there was no answer   it s jeff chadwick   he s been calling here for half an hour   i think he s here   what do you want   i know what scares you   i m coming to get you   here comes your number   that s liz and

lab work on the laptop   the shanti virus   does it really take away a person s abilities   it also has the unfortunate side effect of killing the person infected   is that why your powers are gone  that you have this virus   gabriel   what are you doing   maya  i need you to stay calm   apparently  mohinder  your blood is the answer to my ills   no  no  not always   trust me  there are many different strains of the virus   but when you mix it with a certain cheerleader s blood   it changes  doesn t it  and it heals anything  isn t that right  doctor   you lied to me   i don t know what

early release from jail   you didn t kill anyone  mom   but adam monroe did  again   victoria pratt is dead   i found her body at her place in maine   adam signed it with one of these   where s adam going next   how long are we going to suffer for your sins   for your generation s deeds   adam wanted revenge on those of us who betrayed him   it s done now let it go  nathan   it s over   peter s alive   mom   and he s working with adam   they both killed victoria pratt   their fingerprints are all over the murder scene   it all went so wrong   thirty years ago   a group of us came together to change the world  to fix it   and adam   had a perspective on history that was compelling   and we believed in him   i did   linderman  your father   bob said you locked him away   no   not at first   in the beginning  i helped him   you what   and in the end  adam decided that the world just wasn t worth fixing   and that it needed to be wiped clean with an unstoppable virus   and just before it was too late  i   i came to realize how wrong it was   did you   you and linderman wanted to blow up new york to save the world   doesn t sound to me like you ve changed much at all  ma   only someone with peter s abilities could get to where the virus is stored   that s why adam chose him   where would that be  mrs  petrelli   odessa   texas  primatech   adam will never quit   one bullet  right through his head  it s the only way   come on   if you can t stop peter you ll have to kill   if you can t stop peter you ll have to kill him  too   right through the head   this doesn t look like the sort of place where they d store a virus   that could destroy the world   the paper company s just a front   the good stuff is three floors down   laboratories  jail cells   hiro   peter petrelli   what are you doing here   adam monroe killed my father  and for that he must pay   no   i can t let you hurt him   why are you protecting him   adam is my friend   he was my friend too  400 years ago   he betrayed me   he will betray you   no   he saved my brother s life   he murdered my father   your father had him locked away for 30 years   i know  i was in that same prison   hiro   i went into the future   there s a virus kills almost everyone   and it starts here  today   adam and i are gonna stop it   hiro   he froze time   said he knew you   we were friends once   a very long time ago   he tried to kill you   said i shouldn t trust you   and what did you think about that   let s go destroy the virus   right   i believe this is mine  carp   dad left records of pretty much everything he did for the company   you re really going through with this   they killed dad  they re never going to leave us alone   you do realize what will happen to us if you tell everyone what you can do   yes   no more running  no more hiding  no more secrets   your father couldn t take down this company  claire   what makes you think you can   i don t know if you can understand it   they only target people with abilities   people like me   you re still my daughter  claire   i dream about you going to college  getting married someday   what if they take you from me use you in some lab experiment   i love you  mom   but i can t live in fear of some big  what if   do you realize how much damage you ve done by provoking claire   i couldn t help it  she was just so   weepy and earnest and   who knew she d turn whistle blower   it s totally unprofessional not to mention petty   and claire s not even in your league   she isn t working with a gunshot wound   you and i both know you have performed well below what you can do   you re benched   no more field assignments   how s about if i said i was sorry   when i think about all the hard work i put into raising you   daddy   you said you knew all about my ability   tell me what my dad did to me   i m stuck in this hellhole my family thinks i m dead   there s not a lot of incentive to share   i could make you tell me   you could try   please   i don t have anyone else to talk to   they wanted to see how much wattage you could discharge   enough to power a flashlight  a street lamp  an entire city block   during testing  you d pass out from the strain   we d all want to call it a day  but daddy said   no  my girl s tougher than that   you were seven   you know  the hardest thing a parent ever does   is to have to see their child in pain   most parents   elle   what are you doing here   leaving   noah  we have a problem   i m not part of your we  do you remember   this is about claire   she s becoming difficult   is she   i need to know if she could possibly have any hard evidence   which could leave this company exposed   that s unfortunate   because now we re going to have to take measures to keep your daughter quiet   mom  micah   oh  god  where have you been i ve been looking everywhere for you   monica tried to get my stuff back that was stolen  dad s medal  my comics   i told you to let the police handle

strength anymore   what   the virus  it has side effects   but it s okay  i got a call from dr  suresh  he maybe found a cure   he s on his way here to make me better   i hope so   but right now monica needs my help   so all you have to do is drive   warning  security breach   unauthorized personnel in the area   i believe it s up to the left   oh  please  it s been 30 years   warning  security breach unauthorized personnel   take care of that  will you   so what do we do now   i guess you ll have to pry it open with that brain of yours   i m not sure i have that sort of power   there s not much at stake here just the fate of the entire human race   did you kill hiro s father   i did   he saw to it that the virus be safely kept here   if he didn t plan to use it  why not destroy it   why don t you make me believe you  adam  hiro said not to trust   the woman you love is trapped in some horrible future   where nearly everyone s dead   you can change that   she needs you  peter   we all need you to open that door   you are nothing like you said you were alejandro was right about you all along   you want to get rid of your powers  i want mine back   after suresh fixes me  i ll gladly take yours off your hands   there s a bed over there   stay put  stay calm and remember   mohinder   it ll be okay  molly  i promise   so this is your laboratory  huh   i killed that artist  isaac mendez  right on this very spot   i need to have to take a sample of your blood   why   you self diagnosed   i need to know what strain of the virus you have   or if you even have it at all   just give me the remedy   it doesn t work like that  the wrong dosage would kill you   your father helped me find my gift  and now here you are restoring it   life has its poetry  doesn t

gonna be so proud of me   where am i   that doesn t matter   both you and it are about to get country fried   please  let me go   i swear  i was only trying to help somebody   you should have thought about that   before you started messing up my business   so you thought you was gonna be a hero  huh   you know what happens to heroes in the real world   they end up dead  just like you   turn left here   explain to me how that works   monica has a cell phone   and the battery emits a tiny gps signal which i can use to triangulate her position   basically  i told your cell phone to find her cell phone and show me where it is   you told the phone   yeah   don t slow down the light will change   let me guess  you told it to   whoa  whoa  whoa  slow down  slow down  slow down   okay  we don t talk about that ever again   agreed   look  before we go in  i need to know something   is peter as dangerous as he was in kirby plaza   you know  with the whole   i haven t seen him since that night but i trust him with my life  parkman   yeah  but your mother   your mother told me that if i had to  that i should kill peter   listening to my mother has never led to anything good   if peter

rules didn t apply to us   i think you misunderstood me   if we show everyone what we can do  they ll listen to us   i can t   i like my secrets   and i liked finding in you   someone who i could share that with   but after you go public  it s all gone   you saw what they did to my dad   this is the only way to beat them   exposing us isn t going to bring him back   fine   here s your file  it
