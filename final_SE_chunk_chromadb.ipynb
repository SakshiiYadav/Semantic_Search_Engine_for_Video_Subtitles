cutting contact 242 and i think i felt bad for my uncle and my aunt 243 because it feels like betrayal 244 they raised me with a lot of love 245 yes  i think i understand 246 but i still think you should face it head on 247 the betrayal you feel from your birth mother 248 the complicated feelings of 249 thankfulness and remorse toward your aunt and uncle 250 and the difficulty of pretending not to know about the postcards 251 you need to face those emotions if you re ever going to overcome your trauma 252 that s just my opinion 253 i should give the doctor a call 254 lee sun ok  can you accept my apology and take this 255 forget it i don t want it 256 can you get out of my way 257 i may be invisible to you but this is my bed after all 258 yeah 259 but sun ok can you give it a rest

you   does anyone out there have any cold war facts   of your own  that you would like to share   with us in this moment   we re obviously obsessed with this stuff   we could talk about it forever   but just wanna make sure i can open up the floor   to all of you   oh  i see a hand back there     anna  during the cold war   people were told to hide under their desks   students  just in case there was a nuclear bomb   they thought that would save them    oh  interesting    duck and cover  right    duck and cover  yeah   what s your name     anna  my name s anna    give it up for anna  anna    everybody audience cheers and claps   now  anna s really onto something here   it s true  it s true   uh  the government did actually write a song   promoting getting under your desk to kids   as if it was this  like  fun thing to do   and the song goes something like this    there was a turtle by the name of bert     and bert  that turtle  was very alert     when danger threatened him     he never got hurt     he knew just what to do     he d duck and cover     duck and cover    hey   so yeah  that s a real song   and it does not work  just in case you re wondering   but thank you  anna   thanks for that van laughs darkly   um  so  piggybacking off of  uh  that wonderful fact   we ve learned quite a bit of information   in our extensive research on wikipedia   the people s encyclopedia   just on the context for the space race   you know  why do these two countries come together   in this way  and that really begins in earnest   when  van    1940   the great purge   stalin was paranoid that everybody wanted to kill  im   which they did   so he was like   gather up anybody who might even seem   like a traitor   one million people were killed   five million went to prison   including the chief designer    stuck here     it s terrible    remember that song    i do audience laughing    all right    i do  van audience claps   uh  so while the chief designer was in the gulag   writing songs about dogs   world war ii was raging  right   and in 1941  the significance of that year   amongst many things   is that russia and america started out on opposite sides   but in june of  41  the nazis fucked over the soviets   which led the russians to run back to the allied forces   with their tails between their legs    now  we go to 1945  when   the allies win the war    hey audience cheers and claps    usa  450 000 casualties   ussr   24 million casualties   america thrives   russia is broken    mad  mad    these two allies start seeing things differently   they both want control of the world    and thus  a new war begins  and thus  a new war begins    only this war only  only this war only    took place behind  took place behind    closed doors  closed doors    now we go to 1951  where we get the first weightless dogs   i just did that part   i was standing right here   we remember that  right    yeah audience claps   tsygan and dezik    how are we feeling

we have to stop whoever s behind this before someone else gets hurt    so you re the ones they re looking for  who are you talking about   smile   catherine  who d do that to somebody   i don t know  whoever it is  they just made us   we re screwed  the experiments were bad enough   but now that there are targets on our backs  i don t know   are you ready to do this  get married   glass breaks   come on  go   advertise your product or brand here contact www opensubtitles org today   that could ve left a mark   would ve served you right why are you sneaking up on me   i whistled  didn t you hear me whistle  it s our code  right   codes  we shouldn t need codes we should be getting married   planning our honeymoon not running for our lives   we re not running for our lives  we re just   we re buying time  okay until we can figure out how to    stop a superhuman assassin  yeah  that   we ve been on the run for three days  and somehow he keeps finding us    it s not looking good  well  he hasn t gotten us yet  has he   yeah  because he jumped through a stained glass window    and landed like a cat  mm hm  i can do that too    he has superhuman strength  well  i have super beast strength   bullets can t even stop him   he s got me there   this isn t a joke  vincent we re not moving forward   we re moving backward we re living in the shadows    just like you used to  yes  until you rescued me  right   yeah  but now we have to rescue each other   whoever is behind these experiments knows who we are now   that doesn t just put us in danger   it puts everyone we care about in danger too   which means he s not gonna stop coming after us until he succeeds   which is why we gotta put our focus back on whoever sent the guy  okay   cut the head off the snake stop them before they stop us   so we can finally get married   that s if you still want to get married   no  of course i want to get married   i love you  vincent you know that   it s just sometimes i wonder if it s ever really gonna happen   hamlin  this is detective hamlin   please  don t touch my things   that includes my gummy worms    forbes  hey  uh  can you talk   can you believe this guy    you on a burner phone  yeah  yeah  i am   what s going on  any problems   no  i like having roommates again  it s so not private   protective custody sucks   i m sorry  j t  we just can t take any chances   not for you  tess  heather   i know  i know  but i don t have to like it  do i   this is not the cop i want to be sleeping with   if you know what i mean   okay  well  as soon as we find out who s behind these experiments   the sooner we can get on with our lives   any progress   i ran genome sequencing on some of the outbreak victims   the ones that were enhanced by the parasite    okay  and  i identified   trace amounts of methyl aldehyde   in the delivery system aka formaldehyde   okay  i don t understand how does that help   distribution is highly regulated so not many labs are gonna have it   so if we can find the lab  we can figure out who s behind this   yeah  someone s gotta be making these highly complex serums  right    how many labs  j  t  uh  around 200   two hundred  are you kidding me  man  you gotta narrow it down   hey  give me a break don t you think i m trying   i don t have the processing capacity to do it here   and i can t very well sneak off to the university towing bodyguards   okay  i m sorry man  i m just   i m frustrated  and i m hungry  and i m cold   it s okay  i understand   wait  wait  doesn t the hospital have supercomputers   yeah  they do   but how are you gonna get in without somebody noticing   especially the guy who s trying to kill you   we gotta get out of here  come on   hello  vincent   you there   vincent   hello  vincent    what have we got  chemical accident  third degree burns    or s prepped and waiting  what  on whose order    dr  keller s  oh  keller  okay  fifth floor   thank you  fifth floor  gentlemen   clear   all right  i owe you guys  thanks   no way  you saved my son doc  you guys gonna be all right   yeah  we ll be okay   all right  take it easy  guys   let s go   okay   okay  hopefully i can access the mainframe from here   cross it over to j t  off site  so he can narrow down the list of labs   okay  i found a candy bar and an apple   living the dream i ll take the apple   oh  okay  here    any  uh  clean clothes in there  yeah  scrubs  blue   and hibiscus pink    no wedding dress or tux  by chance  no  sorry   you know  j t  was right  i mean  there are so many labs   this is gonna take days to narrow down   yeah  we don t have days neither do our friends and family    tess can t protect them forever  so  what are you suggesting   i m suggesting that we stop running  that we leave town   i hate to break it to you  but the assassin will keep following us   right  and if we draw him out  at least everyone else will be safe   and give j t  time to narrow down this list  and figure out who s behind it all   actually i m thinking that we can figure out who s behind this ourselves    by leaving town  by controlling the situation  yes   think about it  we ve been on the defensive   ever since his first attack  and it isn t working   we have gotta turn the tables  go on the offense   control where and when the next attack happens  surprise him for once   catherine  we re gonna need a pretty good reason to leave town   otherwise he s gonna think it s a trap   yeah  well  maybe we should elope   you gotta be kidding me  no   not actually elope  obviously just make him think that we are   we re barely one step ahead of him as it is   he s gonna believe that we re just taking off to elope   because he knows how desperate we are   he first attacked us in a church   maybe he thinks we re desperate to get married before he kills us   look  i don t know  i m just  i m tired  and i m hung   all screaming   growls   don t  someone might see you   alarm ringing   woman  all personnel we have a code silver   code silver  all hospital personnel   come on  we gotta stop him   that s it  we re definitely eloping   vincent  well    no sign of him  yet   don t forget to bring two forms of id  for the marriage license   right   come on  are you really serious about going through with this    do you have a better idea  than luring him out of town  no    but eloping  okay  it s just a ruse  vincent   it s a reason for us to get out of town so he doesn t think it s a trap   unless he thinks that s exactly what it is   but if he does  he s still gonna follow us   and we can control the where and the when   okay  but what if we actually have to go through with this   before he attacks us   then we do  don t forget a tie we need to make it look legit   okay  wait a minute  are you   are you completely okay with this    relax  i already told you  yeah  okay  i know it s a ruse   but it also sounds like you re okay with it if it s not   okay  i don t know if you re aware of this  vincent   but there is a superhuman assassin after us    can we talk about this later  no  no  we can t  okay   i don t want to elope   i want to get married the right way  the way we deserve   in front of friends and family   but we can t invite our friends and family   that s the whole point of us going to niagara falls  to protect them   i m not talking about the plan i am talking about our wedding   or at least the wedding that i thought we would have   vincent  it is just a ruse   okay  yes  but would you or wouldn t you be okay if it wasn t   i don t know  maybe   vincent  all i know is that i love you and i want to be your wife   and the sooner the better don t you want that too   yes  of course it is  okay  but   okay  the only way to do that is for us to get our lives back first   what are we gonna tell your sister or j t  or tess  for that matter   we are not going to tell them anything  we can t  for their own safety   especially tess  she s already risked too much   trying to get everybody police protection   i don t want her to get hurt helping us   okay   okay  i think we ve got everything are we doing this thing or not    i guess  vincent keller  i love you   and i don t need a piece of paper to prove it   but the bad guy might   all right  let us go and get our  happily ever after  back    the chief s still holding  all right  tell him i m in a meeting    that s what i told him last time  well    what are you doing here  oh  hey  sorry  i    i need a minute  but the chief sounds really upset    captain  i think he wants to  i know what he wants  i ll call back   if you re interested he wants to know   why i authorized the extra police protection   he wants to know what it s for   but i can t tell him  of course  because it s about all this superhuman crap   which brings me to  what the hell are you doing here   you re mad   oh  j t  see that s why i love you   you always pick up on the tiniest detail   i know  i m sorry   i m sorry  look  i m sorry  i just  i don t know how to juggle it all  okay   i am responsible for real cases  police cases    and i keep getting sidetracked by  formaldehyde    what  i think i just narrowed down   the list of labs for vincent   we re trying to backtrack who infected   all those innocent victims a few days ago   to try to find who s behind the experiments   not what i was talking about  but okay  hold on   are you using my security clearance to gain access to classified information   well  yeah  that s why i m here i couldn t do it from my place   certainly not with those thugs breathing down my neck   thugs  those are cops  j t   they re my cops  would ve been nice if you told me you were coming here   i could ve taken them off the clock  saved myself a little grief   well  hopefully it ll all be over with soon   gotta be one of these three labs   you re not even listening to me   huh  come on  a superhuman crazy   is trying to kill cat and vincent  and they need my help    what am i supposed to do  never mind   tess   what  cat and vincent are leaving   why  call heather  maybe she knows something   julianna  i see on your r sum you were working pr in the city   heather  pretty consistently  yes    and then you relocated to miami  briefly    and now you re back  permanently    yet no permanent address  oh  well  actually  i m in between   uh  ms  keaton  i know how it looks but  um  you can check my references   and they ll tell you that i m driven  i m dedicated   cell phone ringing   i m focused  and 100 percent ready   for this job   sorry  um  you can see on my r sum   that i assisted publicity for two of the largest firms on wall street   i also   cell phone ringing   i am really sorry  i don t know what s going on here   um  this is certainly not the norm   really  and are they part of the norm   that  no  they re temporary   my sister s a cop  and she s sort of going through this thing  and  um   cell phone beeps   i m sorry  ms  chandler  i ve heard good things about you   but i need someone who s a little less distracted   cat  it s your sister responding to your text message   which  aside from being rude because it was a group text   pretty much just cost me a job   or was it the goons who are shadowing me   because someone s after you   or maybe it was j t  and tess calling to see if i knew   why the hell you decided to bolt town without telling anyone first   as if that would make me worry about you any less  god   i didn t even get a chance to pitch my totally cool throwback idea   on mixing old hollywood and young hollywood pinups   to help them sell their cosmetic line to both demographics   but thanks to you  i   i m so sorry  i was just leaving   wait  that was actually an interesting pitch  the pinups idea   why didn t you tell me that in the first place   looks like he s taking the bait   man  it s me  looks like they re going to niagara falls   it could be a trap should i still follow   don t worry  i ll bring them back alive   wait  he s not trying to kill us   i know  might explain why we keep getting away from him   catherine  why would whoever s behind this want us back alive   vincent  i don t know but whatever the reason is   i think he knows it s a trap   look  maybe we should just head back  right   no  he s still following us  we stick to the plan   at least we know he s after us and not our friends   till death do us part  right   yeah  till death do us part   catherine  he could be here already   watching us  waiting to make his move   well  hopefully  he does before we elope    vincent  what  i don t have to like it  do i   we re not here to elope  we re here to trap the guy who s chasing us    protect our friends and family  by eloping   yes  and even if we have to go through with the ceremony   it doesn t have to count  not if we don t file the marriage certificate afterwards    are you completely sure about that  you are such a romantic   well  i m trying to be   woman  niagara falls marriage service hours are   okay  let s say he does fall for this ridiculous plan   how do we capture the guy    i m starting to think we don t have to  what   the more i think about it  the more i think we should let him catch us    that s what he wants anyway  right  yeah  what   so we make him think that he succeeded    something like that  yeah  and then what   okay  let s say he takes us back to whoever sent him   how do we get out of there  we saw what he can do with bullets    i hate to think what else he can do  yeah  but he hasn t seen   what you can do yet   for

best man speech ready  it s memorized   okay  we re next  come on   the good news is that i think i might have found   the lab that made the serum and if so  then you won t have to    go through with any of this  are you sure    i ll know as soon as i go check it out  no  no   don t go on your own  it s too dangerous    just wait for us to get back  i can t  tess is totally pressuring me   besides

hear me  i m heading to the lab  but don t tell tess    what are you doing  i got him   shouts   damn it  stop wait  i can explain   no  you know  maybe we should just let this couple go ahead of us

vincent    problem  no   yes  yes  there is  this    this isn t right  vincent   i m sorry  i really am  i m sorry    excuse me  okay  we ll be right back   vincent    do you realize what you just did  yeah  i just stopped us from ruining   what should ve been the best day of our lives   no  you may have just ruined our best chance   to find out who s behind all this   and for what  because you don t want to elope   yes  yes  that is exactly why i did it   but we were never really going to do that   yes  we were  okay maybe not technically   but we were about to recite the vows  catherine   so what if we did  what difference does it make    it s just a piece of paper  no  no  it s not   okay  it s supposed to be one of the most important things   that we can do in our lives  okay   it s not us applying for some damn driver s license   we re getting married  okay  it shouldn t be some stupid ruse   i don t understand why you re acting this way   exactly  exactly  you don t  you don t understand   you know  that in there that may be enough for you   but that s not enough for me  okay   i want us to remember our wedding day just like my parents did   you know  the whole time i was growing up   that s all they ever spoke about   you know  their wedding like it was something magical   and i know it s corny  it is  but i want it to be magical for us too   i just  i can t believe that you don t   man  okay  nice big smiles  everybody   wedding march playing over speakers   catherine  catherine    that s close enough  okay  just don t hurt her  all right    tell us what you want  i want you to come with me   or your bride dies   okay  all right   all right   is this really necessary you re detaining me  really   j t  you tried to run away from your detail   i couldn t let them follow me  okay   i had to ditch them because i think i might have found   the lab behind all the experiments   so what  you can t pick up a phone and call me    you would ve let me go  to check out the lab by yourself  no   exactly  tess  you don t understand  this could be everything   if this lab s what i think it is  it can lead us right to whoever s behind it all   look  all i know is that i m risking my job to protect you   and you and everybody else are just trying to get rid of your protection   you don t think about how it reflects on me   you don t understand this could be it   we could be this close to solving all this superhuman crap   and getting it out of all of our lives once and for all    that s not what i m talking about  but that s all that matters right now   look  tess  don t worry   i already figured out how to get around lab security   so i can see what s really going on inside   without cat and vincent   yeah  but just to check it out until they get back  trust me  tess   this is important  i know what i m doing   you know what  j t  this is important too  and so is my job   doesn t it matter to you at all   of course it does  but i gotta do this  for cat and vincent    thanks for coming  we didn t have much of a choice   true   okay  you wanna tell us who you are   my name is julianna   but i m more interested in who you are and why you ve been trying to stop me   that s what we do stop people like you   you have no idea who i am   that s why we let your friend here capture us  to find out   growling   vincent    how d you know  that vincent s a beast   truth is  i should ve probably figured it out sooner   luckily  though  my new assistant came through   cat  i m sorry  cat   my sister has nothing to do with this  please  let her go   you need to start answering my questions  catherine   and tell me who you re really working for   i already told you  i work at the 125th  i m a detective in the n y p d   and vincent s just a doctor at new york general  clearly    what do you want me to say  i want you to say   how you were able to take down bob and carol hall   and how you subdued zane  alton   and all my other enhanced test subjects   except for him  he s a little more enhanced   you know who vincent really is you know what he s capable of    doesn t that answer your questions  it doesn t answer who sent you    or how he found out where i am  i don t know who you re talking about   shouts   no   no  please  stop   please  don t do this   that s enough   you re gonna tell me exactly where he s hiding   or we re gonna find out how much you re willing to see your fianc  suffer    j t  heather   they might hear you   what the hell is going on   i don t know  but they might kill them  we have to do something   what happened to you  are you okay   i don t know  i ve never been beaten up before    how did you know i was here  i didn t   i just came to see if this was the right lab  but what are you doing here   julianna tricked me   i thought i got a new job but she forced me to talk  i   i didn t mean to say anything   but they threatened to kill me and i didn t know what else to do   what do you mean what did you say   i told them about vincent about what he really is   what did they do to him   they shot him with the tranq gun before he could   here she comes  put your hands behind your back like they re still tied   door closes   julianna  if i m wrong  so  what are we gonna do   we gotta get vincent to wake up somehow  beast out   maybe find a little something to give him a boost   you are running out of time i am running out of patience   what is that   the enhancement serum you re familiar with   is the product of years of trial and error   all to try and stop the man who sent you   but this  this is a failed attempt   pushed the nervous system too far  caused a painful overdose   please  don t  i am telling you the truth   in a city of 8 million people   you zeroed in on my test subjects by chance  i don t think so   dhs knew about your experiments long before we did   we were just helping them    dhs hired a beast  really  yes  they did    what ll that do to him  hopefully  make him beast out    kick some ass  what s in it   a lot of things  epinephrine testosterone  steroids   it ll give vincent a hell of a jolt  that s for sure   we just need to find a delivery system   will this help   nice   who are you talking about  vincent   vincent  i m sorry  i don t know what to do   it s okay   no  it isn t  you have to wake up  you have to fight   you have to do everything you can  i can t lose you    i love you  no  vincent   last chance    what are you waiting for  shh  we only get one shot at this   please  you have to believe me we are not working for anyone    i don t know who you re talking about  wrong answer   growling   grunting and shouting   cat  don t   woman  dr  moline to oncology dr  moline to oncology  please    how is she  well  she s   she s in an induced coma until she can recover    will she recover  it s hard to say   look  catherine  it s not your fault  okay   she was gonna kill me  and after everything she s put us through   i know  i know  but there s supposed to be a difference   between people like her and people like us    i guess i just lost it  well  better you than me  right   do you believe what she was saying   that she did all this to stop somebody else   i don t know  i think that s more her problem than ours   besides  it s hard to believe that there is someone out there   that s worse than her   at least she won t be experimenting on innocents anymore    whatever the reason  well  that s all we set out to stop   when this first started  right    you guys okay  can we get back to you on that   yeah  hey  how long do you think we can keep her on the jail ward for    hey  you re the doctor  you tell me  okay   if it s all right  i d rather not admit her as a jane doe   it s just kind of dicey with all the covering i ve done lately    yeah  i am so sorry  tess  no  no  no  don t apologize   it is what it is  and most importantly  you caught the big bad   well  actually  it was your boyfriend who helped us out    really  yeah   without j t  and heather we wouldn t have made it    vincent wouldn t be alive  yeah  well  i m not surprised   j t  always comes through for vincent   no matter what   hey  no need to apologize   and you can hold the congratulations  it was a team effort    what s going on  i really love this sweatshirt    yeah  i noticed  that s hard to believe   well  you sleep in it almost every night   and i love to see you in it  it looks good on you   where are you going with this  tess  talk to me   look  j t  you saved the day   you know  you solved the grand mythological mystery   it s just that you didn t give a rat s ass about what i was going through   or what i needed    i m sorry  i  no  don t   look  tess  i admit  i   i was preoccupied with finding the guy   woman  as it turns out   behind it all   but it was worth it right  i was trying to help    i was trying to keep us safe  and you did   you did  and i m grateful  i really am  you did a good thing    so  what s the problem  i don t know   i don t know what the problem is  okay   maybe it s because you ve been helping vincent for years   maybe it s guilt because he s a beast  or loyalty to him  i don t know   but all i know is that you re not loyal to me  j t  at least not emotionally   and maybe  it is  it s selfish of me to want that  and if it is  so be it   but i want to be with someone who puts me first   who cares about what i need first   and that s not you   tess    i can t believe i almost lost you  what s new   yeah  but this time it was different julianna was going to kill you   and there was nothing i could do but watch it happen   but it didn t happen   i just kept thinking about you dying  us dying   without ever getting a chance to get married   well  it s a good thing we didn t elope  then  right   yeah  it is   my parents  they didn t romanticize their wedding the way yours did   oh  well  you know everybody s different  you know   doesn t mean they didn t love each other   no  i know  and they did   it wasn t until it hit me that we might not get a real wedding   that i realized that i might want one    do you  yeah  yeah  i do   especially after everything we ve been through to get here  against all odds   i don t want to lose you without celebrating what we have together   i want to marry you  vincent keller and treasure those memories forever    i love you  i love you too   please rate this subtitle at www osdb link b33mt \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

cutting contact 242 and i think i felt bad for my uncle and my aunt 243 because it feels like betrayal 244 they raised me with a lot of love 245 yes  i think i understand 246 but i still think you should face it head on 247 the betrayal you feel from your birth mother 248 the complicated feelings of 249 thankfulness and remorse toward your aunt and uncle 250 and the difficulty of pretending not to know about the postcards 251 you need to face those emotions if you re ever going to overcome your trauma 252 that s just my opinion 253 i should give the doctor a call 254 lee sun ok  can you accept my apology and take this 255 forget it i don t want it 256 can you get out of my way 257 i may be invisible to you but this is my bed after all 258 yeah 259 but sun ok can you give it a rest

you   does anyone out there have any cold war facts   of your own  that you would like to share   with us in this moment   we re obviously obsessed with this stuff   we could talk about it forever   but just wanna make sure i can open up the floor   to all of you   oh  i see a hand back there     anna  during the cold war   people were told to hide under their desks   students  just in case there was a nuclear bomb   they thought that would save them    oh  interesting    duck and cover  right    duck and cover  yeah   what s your name     anna  my name s anna    give it up for anna  anna    everybody audience cheers and claps   now  anna s really onto something here   it s true  it s true   uh  the government did actually write a song   promoting getting under your desk to kids   as if it was this  like  fun thing to do   and the song goes something like this    there was a turtle by the name of bert     and bert  that turtle  was very alert     when danger threatened him     he never got hurt     he knew just what to do     he d duck and cover     duck and cover    hey   so yeah  that s a real song   and it does not work  just in case you re wondering   but thank you  anna   thanks for that van laughs darkly   um  so  piggybacking off of  uh  that wonderful fact   we ve learned quite a bit of information   in our extensive research on wikipedia   the people s encyclopedia   just on the context for the space race   you know  why do these two countries come together   in this way  and that really begins in earnest   when  van    1940   the great purge   stalin was paranoid that everybody wanted to kill  im   which they did   so he was like   gather up anybody who might even seem   like a traitor   one million people were killed   five million went to prison   including the chief designer    stuck here     it s terrible    remember that song    i do audience laughing    all right    i do  van audience claps   uh  so while the chief designer was in the gulag   writing songs about dogs   world war ii was raging  right   and in 1941  the significance of that year   amongst many things   is that russia and america started out on opposite sides   but in june of  41  the nazis fucked over the soviets   which led the russians to run back to the allied forces   with their tails between their legs    now  we go to 1945  when   the allies win the war    hey audience cheers and claps    usa  450 000 casualties   ussr   24 million casualties   america thrives   russia is broken    mad  mad    these two allies start seeing things differently   they both want control of the world    and thus  a new war begins  and thus  a new war begins    only this war only  only this war only    took place behind  took place behind    closed doors  closed doors    now we go to 1951  where we get the first weightless dogs   i just did that part   i was standing right here   we remember that  right    yeah audience claps   tsygan and dezik    how are we feeling

we have to stop whoever s behind this before someone else gets hurt    so you re the ones they re looking for  who are you talking about   smile   catherine  who d do that to somebody   i don t know  whoever it is  they just made us   we re screwed  the experiments were bad enough   but now that there are targets on our backs  i don t know   are you ready to do this  get married   glass breaks   come on  go   advertise your product or brand here contact www opensubtitles org today   that could ve left a mark   would ve served you right why are you sneaking up on me   i whistled  didn t you hear me whistle  it s our code  right   codes  we shouldn t need codes we should be getting married   planning our honeymoon not running for our lives   we re not running for our lives  we re just   we re buying time  okay until we can figure out how to    stop a superhuman assassin  yeah  that   we ve been on the run for three days  and somehow he keeps finding us    it s not looking good  well  he hasn t gotten us yet  has he   yeah  because he jumped through a stained glass window    and landed like a cat  mm hm  i can do that too    he has superhuman strength  well  i have super beast strength   bullets can t even stop him   he s got me there   this isn t a joke  vincent we re not moving forward   we re moving backward we re living in the shadows    just like you used to  yes  until you rescued me  right   yeah  but now we have to rescue each other   whoever is behind these experiments knows who we are now   that doesn t just put us in danger   it puts everyone we care about in danger too   which means he s not gonna stop coming after us until he succeeds   which is why we gotta put our focus back on whoever sent the guy  okay   cut the head off the snake stop them before they stop us   so we can finally get married   that s if you still want to get married   no  of course i want to get married   i love you  vincent you know that   it s just sometimes i wonder if it s ever really gonna happen   hamlin  this is detective hamlin   please  don t touch my things   that includes my gummy worms    forbes  hey  uh  can you talk   can you believe this guy    you on a burner phone  yeah  yeah  i am   what s going on  any problems   no  i like having roommates again  it s so not private   protective custody sucks   i m sorry  j t  we just can t take any chances   not for you  tess  heather   i know  i know  but i don t have to like it  do i   this is not the cop i want to be sleeping with   if you know what i mean   okay  well  as soon as we find out who s behind these experiments   the sooner we can get on with our lives   any progress   i ran genome sequencing on some of the outbreak victims   the ones that were enhanced by the parasite    okay  and  i identified   trace amounts of methyl aldehyde   in the delivery system aka formaldehyde   okay  i don t understand how does that help   distribution is highly regulated so not many labs are gonna have it   so if we can find the lab  we can figure out who s behind this   yeah  someone s gotta be making these highly complex serums  right    how many labs  j  t  uh  around 200   two hundred  are you kidding me  man  you gotta narrow it down   hey  give me a break don t you think i m trying   i don t have the processing capacity to do it here   and i can t very well sneak off to the university towing bodyguards   okay  i m sorry man  i m just   i m frustrated  and i m hungry  and i m cold   it s okay  i understand   wait  wait  doesn t the hospital have supercomputers   yeah  they do   but how are you gonna get in without somebody noticing   especially the guy who s trying to kill you   we gotta get out of here  come on   hello  vincent   you there   vincent   hello  vincent    what have we got  chemical accident  third degree burns    or s prepped and waiting  what  on whose order    dr  keller s  oh  keller  okay  fifth floor   thank you  fifth floor  gentlemen   clear   all right  i owe you guys  thanks   no way  you saved my son doc  you guys gonna be all right   yeah  we ll be okay   all right  take it easy  guys   let s go   okay   okay  hopefully i can access the mainframe from here   cross it over to j t  off site  so he can narrow down the list of labs   okay  i found a candy bar and an apple   living the dream i ll take the apple   oh  okay  here    any  uh  clean clothes in there  yeah  scrubs  blue   and hibiscus pink    no wedding dress or tux  by chance  no  sorry   you know  j t  was right  i mean  there are so many labs   this is gonna take days to narrow down   yeah  we don t have days neither do our friends and family    tess can t protect them forever  so  what are you suggesting   i m suggesting that we stop running  that we leave town   i hate to break it to you  but the assassin will keep following us   right  and if we draw him out  at least everyone else will be safe   and give j t  time to narrow down this list  and figure out who s behind it all   actually i m thinking that we can figure out who s behind this ourselves    by leaving town  by controlling the situation  yes   think about it  we ve been on the defensive   ever since his first attack  and it isn t working   we have gotta turn the tables  go on the offense   control where and when the next attack happens  surprise him for once   catherine  we re gonna need a pretty good reason to leave town   otherwise he s gonna think it s a trap   yeah  well  maybe we should elope   you gotta be kidding me  no   not actually elope  obviously just make him think that we are   we re barely one step ahead of him as it is   he s gonna believe that we re just taking off to elope   because he knows how desperate we are   he first attacked us in a church   maybe he thinks we re desperate to get married before he kills us   look  i don t know  i m just  i m tired  and i m hung   all screaming   growls   don t  someone might see you   alarm ringing   woman  all personnel we have a code silver   code silver  all hospital personnel   come on  we gotta stop him   that s it  we re definitely eloping   vincent  well    no sign of him  yet   don t forget to bring two forms of id  for the marriage license   right   come on  are you really serious about going through with this    do you have a better idea  than luring him out of town  no    but eloping  okay  it s just a ruse  vincent   it s a reason for us to get out of town so he doesn t think it s a trap   unless he thinks that s exactly what it is   but if he does  he s still gonna follow us   and we can control the where and the when   okay  but what if we actually have to go through with this   before he attacks us   then we do  don t forget a tie we need to make it look legit   okay  wait a minute  are you   are you completely okay with this    relax  i already told you  yeah  okay  i know it s a ruse   but it also sounds like you re okay with it if it s not   okay  i don t know if you re aware of this  vincent   but there is a superhuman assassin after us    can we talk about this later  no  no  we can t  okay   i don t want to elope   i want to get married the right way  the way we deserve   in front of friends and family   but we can t invite our friends and family   that s the whole point of us going to niagara falls  to protect them   i m not talking about the plan i am talking about our wedding   or at least the wedding that i thought we would have   vincent  it is just a ruse   okay  yes  but would you or wouldn t you be okay if it wasn t   i don t know  maybe   vincent  all i know is that i love you and i want to be your wife   and the sooner the better don t you want that too   yes  of course it is  okay  but   okay  the only way to do that is for us to get our lives back first   what are we gonna tell your sister or j t  or tess  for that matter   we are not going to tell them anything  we can t  for their own safety   especially tess  she s already risked too much   trying to get everybody police protection   i don t want her to get hurt helping us   okay   okay  i think we ve got everything are we doing this thing or not    i guess  vincent keller  i love you   and i don t need a piece of paper to prove it   but the bad guy might   all right  let us go and get our  happily ever after  back    the chief s still holding  all right  tell him i m in a meeting    that s what i told him last time  well    what are you doing here  oh  hey  sorry  i    i need a minute  but the chief sounds really upset    captain  i think he wants to  i know what he wants  i ll call back   if you re interested he wants to know   why i authorized the extra police protection   he wants to know what it s for   but i can t tell him  of course  because it s about all this superhuman crap   which brings me to  what the hell are you doing here   you re mad   oh  j t  see that s why i love you   you always pick up on the tiniest detail   i know  i m sorry   i m sorry  look  i m sorry  i just  i don t know how to juggle it all  okay   i am responsible for real cases  police cases    and i keep getting sidetracked by  formaldehyde    what  i think i just narrowed down   the list of labs for vincent   we re trying to backtrack who infected   all those innocent victims a few days ago   to try to find who s behind the experiments   not what i was talking about  but okay  hold on   are you using my security clearance to gain access to classified information   well  yeah  that s why i m here i couldn t do it from my place   certainly not with those thugs breathing down my neck   thugs  those are cops  j t   they re my cops  would ve been nice if you told me you were coming here   i could ve taken them off the clock  saved myself a little grief   well  hopefully it ll all be over with soon   gotta be one of these three labs   you re not even listening to me   huh  come on  a superhuman crazy   is trying to kill cat and vincent  and they need my help    what am i supposed to do  never mind   tess   what  cat and vincent are leaving   why  call heather  maybe she knows something   julianna  i see on your r sum you were working pr in the city   heather  pretty consistently  yes    and then you relocated to miami  briefly    and now you re back  permanently    yet no permanent address  oh  well  actually  i m in between   uh  ms  keaton  i know how it looks but  um  you can check my references   and they ll tell you that i m driven  i m dedicated   cell phone ringing   i m focused  and 100 percent ready   for this job   sorry  um  you can see on my r sum   that i assisted publicity for two of the largest firms on wall street   i also   cell phone ringing   i am really sorry  i don t know what s going on here   um  this is certainly not the norm   really  and are they part of the norm   that  no  they re temporary   my sister s a cop  and she s sort of going through this thing  and  um   cell phone beeps   i m sorry  ms  chandler  i ve heard good things about you   but i need someone who s a little less distracted   cat  it s your sister responding to your text message   which  aside from being rude because it was a group text   pretty much just cost me a job   or was it the goons who are shadowing me   because someone s after you   or maybe it was j t  and tess calling to see if i knew   why the hell you decided to bolt town without telling anyone first   as if that would make me worry about you any less  god   i didn t even get a chance to pitch my totally cool throwback idea   on mixing old hollywood and young hollywood pinups   to help them sell their cosmetic line to both demographics   but thanks to you  i   i m so sorry  i was just leaving   wait  that was actually an interesting pitch  the pinups idea   why didn t you tell me that in the first place   looks like he s taking the bait   man  it s me  looks like they re going to niagara falls   it could be a trap should i still follow   don t worry  i ll bring them back alive   wait  he s not trying to kill us   i know  might explain why we keep getting away from him   catherine  why would whoever s behind this want us back alive   vincent  i don t know but whatever the reason is   i think he knows it s a trap   look  maybe we should just head back  right   no  he s still following us  we stick to the plan   at least we know he s after us and not our friends   till death do us part  right   yeah  till death do us part   catherine  he could be here already   watching us  waiting to make his move   well  hopefully  he does before we elope    vincent  what  i don t have to like it  do i   we re not here to elope  we re here to trap the guy who s chasing us    protect our friends and family  by eloping   yes  and even if we have to go through with the ceremony   it doesn t have to count  not if we don t file the marriage certificate afterwards    are you completely sure about that  you are such a romantic   well  i m trying to be   woman  niagara falls marriage service hours are   okay  let s say he does fall for this ridiculous plan   how do we capture the guy    i m starting to think we don t have to  what   the more i think about it  the more i think we should let him catch us    that s what he wants anyway  right  yeah  what   so we make him think that he succeeded    something like that  yeah  and then what   okay  let s say he takes us back to whoever sent him   how do we get out of there  we saw what he can do with bullets    i hate to think what else he can do  yeah  but he hasn t seen   what you can do yet   for one reason or another every time that he s attacked   you haven t been able to beast out   so i say  let him bring us back to whoever s behind this   and then surprise   okay  you re banking a hell of a lot   on thinking that they don t know that i am a beast   we know that bob and carol didn t have a chance to tell them   so how could they know   next   welcome to the beginning of the rest of your

for the greater good   oh  you need to sign here  and there too    do i sign my maiden name  are you changing it   we haven t actually discussed that yet   then just sign your maiden name   you can always change it before you file your marriage certificate   right  which means it doesn t actually count  though  until we do  right   is he a foreigner   you know you can t marry him just to make

best man speech ready  it s memorized   okay  we re next  come on   the good news is that i think i might have found   the lab that made the serum and if so  then you won t have to    go through with any of this  are you sure    i ll know as soon as i go check it out  no  no   don t go on your own  it s too dangerous    just wait for us to get back  i can t  tess is totally pressuring me   besides

hear me  i m heading to the lab  but don t tell tess    what are you doing  i got him   shouts   damn it  stop wait  i can explain   no  you know  maybe we should just let this couple go ahead of us

vincent    problem  no   yes  yes  there is  this    this isn t right  vincent   i m sorry  i really am  i m sorry    excuse me  okay  we ll be right back   vincent    do you realize what you just did  yeah  i just stopped us from ruining   what should ve been the best day of our lives   no  you may have just ruined our best chance   to find out who s behind all this   and for what  because you don t want to elope   yes  yes  that is exactly why i did it   but we were never really going to do that   yes  we were  okay maybe not technically   but we were about to recite the vows  catherine   so what if we did  what difference does it make    it s just a piece of paper  no  no  it s not   okay  it s supposed to be one of the most important things   that we can do in our lives  okay   it s not us applying for some damn driver s license   we re getting married  okay  it shouldn t be some stupid ruse   i don t understand why you re acting this way   exactly  exactly  you don t  you don t understand   you know  that in there that may be enough for you   but that s not enough for me  okay   i want us to remember our wedding day just like my parents did   you know  the whole time i was growing up   that s all they ever spoke about   you know  their wedding like it was something magical   and i know it s corny  it is  but i want it to be magical for us too   i just  i can t believe that you don t   man  okay  nice big smiles  everybody   wedding march playing over speakers   catherine  catherine    that s close enough  okay  just don t hurt her  all right    tell us what you want  i want you to come with me   or your bride dies   okay  all right   all right   is this really necessary you re detaining me  really   j t  you tried to run away from your detail   i couldn t let them follow me  okay   i had to ditch them because i think i might have found   the lab behind all the experiments   so what  you can t pick up a phone and call me    you would ve let me go  to check out the lab by yourself  no   exactly  tess  you don t understand  this could be everything   if this lab s what i think it is  it can lead us right to whoever s behind it all   look  all i know is that i m risking my job to protect you   and you and everybody else are just trying to get rid of your protection   you don t think about how it reflects on me   you don t understand this could be it   we could be this close to solving all this superhuman crap   and getting it out of all of our lives once and for all    that s not what i m talking about  but that s all that matters right now   look  tess  don t worry   i already figured out how to get around lab security   so i can see what s really going on inside   without cat and vincent   yeah  but just to check it out until they get back  trust me  tess   this is important  i know what i m doing   you know what  j t  this is important too  and so is my job   doesn t it matter to you at all   of course it does  but i gotta do this  for cat and vincent    thanks for coming  we didn t have much of a choice   true   okay  you wanna tell us who you are   my name is julianna   but i m more interested in who you are and why you ve been trying to stop me   that s what we do stop people like you   you have no idea who i am   that s why we let your friend here capture us  to find out   growling   vincent    how d you know  that vincent s a beast   truth is  i should ve probably figured it out sooner   luckily  though  my new assistant came through   cat  i m sorry  cat   my sister has nothing to do with this  please  let her go   you need to start answering my questions  catherine   and tell me who you re really working for   i already told you  i work at the 125th  i m a detective in the n y p d   and vincent s just a doctor at new york general  clearly    what do you want me to say  i want you to say   how you were able to take down bob and carol hall   and how you subdued zane  alton   and all my other enhanced test subjects   except for him  he s a little more enhanced   you know who vincent really is you know what he s capable of    doesn t that answer your questions  it doesn t answer who sent you    or how he found out where i am  i don t know who you re talking about   shouts   no   no  please  stop   please  don t do this   that s enough   you re gonna tell me exactly where he s hiding   or we re gonna find out how much you re willing to see your fianc  suffer    j t  heather   they might hear you   what the hell is going on   i don t know  but they might kill them  we have to do something   what happened to you  are you okay   i don t know  i ve never been beaten up before    how did you know i was here  i didn t   i just came to see if this was the right lab  but what are you doing here   julianna tricked me   i thought i got a new job but she forced me to talk  i   i didn t mean to say anything   but they threatened to kill me and i didn t know what else to do   what do you mean what did you say   i told them about vincent about what he really is   what did they do to him   they shot him with the tranq gun before he could   here she comes  put your hands behind your back like they re still tied   door closes   julianna  if i m wrong  so  what are we gonna do   we gotta get vincent to wake up somehow  beast out   maybe find a little something to give him a boost   you are running out of time i am running out of patience   what is that   the enhancement serum you re familiar with   is the product of years of trial and error   all to try and stop the man who sent you   but this  this is a failed attempt   pushed the nervous system too far  caused a painful overdose   please  don t  i am telling you the truth   in a city of 8 million people   you zeroed in on my test subjects by chance  i don t think so   dhs knew about your experiments long before we did   we were just helping them    dhs hired a beast  really  yes  they did    what ll that do to him  hopefully  make him beast out    kick some ass  what s in it   a lot of things  epinephrine testosterone  steroids   it ll give vincent a hell of a jolt  that s for sure   we just need to find a delivery system   will this help   nice   who are you talking about  vincent   vincent  i m sorry  i don t know what to do   it s okay   no  it isn t  you have to wake up  you have to fight   you have to do everything you can  i can t lose you    i love you  no  vincent   last chance    what are you waiting for  shh  we only get one shot at this   please  you have to believe me we are not working for anyone    i don t know who you re talking about  wrong answer   growling   grunting and shouting   cat  don t   woman  dr  moline to oncology dr  moline to oncology  please    how is she  well  she s   she s in an induced coma until she can recover    will she recover  it s hard to say   look  catherine  it s not your fault  okay   she was gonna kill me  and after everything she s put us through   i know  i know  but there s supposed to be a difference   between people like her and people like us    i guess i just lost it  well  better you than me  right   do you believe what she was saying   that she did all this to stop somebody else   i don t know  i think that s more her problem than ours   besides  it s hard to believe that there is someone out there   that s worse than her   at least she won t be experimenting on innocents anymore    whatever the reason  well  that s all we set out to stop   when this first started  right    you guys okay  can we get back to you on that   yeah  hey  how long do you think we can keep her on the jail ward for    hey  you re the doctor  you tell me  okay   if it s all right  i d rather not admit her as a jane doe   it s just kind of dicey with all the covering i ve done lately    yeah  i am so sorry  tess  no  no  no  don t apologize   it is what it is  and most importantly  you caught the big bad   well  actually  it was your boyfriend who helped us out    really  yeah   without j t  and heather we wouldn t have made it    vincent wouldn t be alive  yeah  well  i m not surprised   j t  always comes through for vincent   no matter what   hey  no need to apologize   and you can hold the congratulations  it was a team effort    what s going on  i really love this sweatshirt    yeah  i noticed  that s hard to believe   well  you sleep in it almost every night   and i love to see you in it  it looks good on you   where are you going with this  tess  talk to me   look  j t  you saved the day   you know  you solved the grand mythological mystery   it s just that you didn t give a rat s ass about what i was going through   or what i needed    i m sorry  i  no  don t   look  tess  i admit  i   i was preoccupied with finding the guy   woman  as it turns out   behind it all   but it was worth it right  i was trying to help    i was trying to keep us safe  and you did   you did  and i m grateful  i really am  you did a good thing    so  what s the problem  i don t know   i don t know what the problem is  okay   maybe it s because you ve been helping vincent for years   maybe it s guilt because he s a beast  or loyalty to him  i don t know   but all i know is that you re not loyal to me  j t  at least not emotionally   and maybe  it is  it s selfish of me to want that  and if it is  so be it   but i want to be with someone who puts me first   who cares about what i need first   and that s not you   tess    i can t believe i almost lost you  what s new   yeah  but this time it was different julianna was going to kill you   and there was nothing i could do but watch it happen   but it didn t happen   i just kept thinking about you dying  us dying   without ever getting a chance to get married   well  it s a good thing we didn t elope  then  right   yeah  it is   my parents  they didn t romanticize their wedding the way yours did   oh  well  you know everybody s different  you know   doesn t mean they didn t love each other   no  i know  and they did   it wasn t until it hit me that we might not get a real wedding   that i realized that i might want one    do you  yeah  yeah  i do   especially after everything we ve been through to get here  against all odds   i don t want to lose you without celebrating what we have together   i want to marry you  vincent keller and treasure those memories forever    i
